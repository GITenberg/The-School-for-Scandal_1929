    <h2>
      THE TEXT OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The text of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in this edition is taken, by Mr. Fraser
      Rae's generous permission, from his SHERIDAN'S PLAYS NOW PRINTED AS HE
      WROTE THEM. In his Prefatory Notes (xxxvii), Mr. Rae writes: "The
      manuscript of it [THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL] in Sheridan's own handwriting is
      preserved at Frampton Court and is now printed in this volume. This
      version differs in many respects from that which is generally known, and I
      think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and acted.
      As I have endeavoured to reproduce the works of Sheridan as he wrote them,
      I may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very bad at
      spelling. . . . But Sheridan's shortcomings as a speller have been
      exaggerated." Lest "Sheridan's shortcomings" either in spelling or in
      punctuation should obscure the text, I have, in this edition, inserted in
      brackets some explanatory suggestions. It has seemed best, also, to adopt
      a uniform method for indicating stage-directions and abbreviations of the
      names of characters. There can be no gain to the reader in reproducing,
      for example, Sheridan's different indications for the part of Lady
      Sneerwell&mdash;LADY SNEERWELL, LADY SNEER., LADY SN., and LADY S.&mdash;or
      his varying use of EXIT and EX., or his inconsistencies in the use of
      italics in the stage-directions. Since, however, Sheridan's biographers,
      from Moore to Fraser Rae, have shown that no authorised or correct edition
      of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL was published in Sheridan's lifetime, there
      seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of the play itself
      with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript. Mr. Ridgway, who
      repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author, according to
      Moore's account (LIFE OF SHERIDAN, I. p. 260), "was told by Mr. Sheridan,
      as an excuse for keeping it back, that he had been nineteen years
      endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of The School for Scandal,
      but had not yet succeeded." Mr. Rae (SHERIDAN, I. p. 332) recorded his
      discovery of the manuscript of "two acts of The School for Scandal
      prepared by Sheridan for publication," and hoped, before his death, to
      publish this partial revision. Numberless unauthorized changes in the play
      have been made for histrionic purposes, from the first undated Dublin
      edition to that of Mr. Augustin Daly. Current texts may usually be traced,
      directly or indirectly, to the two-volume Murray edition of Sheridan's
      plays, in 1821. Some of the changes from the original manuscript, such as
      the blending of the parts of Miss Verjuice and Snake, are doubtless
      effective for reasons of dramatic economy, but many of the "cuts" are to
      be regretted from the reader's standpoint. The student of English drama
      will prefer Sheridan's own text to editorial emendations, however clever
      or effective for dramatic ends.

    <h1>
      THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL
    </h1>
    <h3>
      ADDRESSED TO MRS. CREWE,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      WITH THE COMEDY OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Tell me, ye prim adepts in Scandal's school,
     Who rail by precept, and detract by rule,
     Lives there no character, so tried, so known,
     So deck'd with grace, and so unlike your own,
     That even you assist her fame to raise,
     Approve by envy, and by silence praise!&mdash;
     Attend!&mdash;a model shall attract your view&mdash;
     Daughters of calumny, I summon you!
     You shall decide if this a portrait prove,
     Or fond creation of the Muse and Love.&mdash;
     Attend, ye virgin critics, shrewd and sage,
     Ye matron censors of this childish age,
     Whose peering eye and wrinkled front declare
     A fixt antipathy to young and fair;
     By cunning, cautious; or by nature, cold,
     In maiden madness, virulently bold!&mdash;
     Attend! ye skilled to coin the precious tale,
     Creating proof, where innuendos fail!
     Whose practised memories, cruelly exact,
     Omit no circumstance, except the fact!&mdash;
     Attend, all ye who boast,&mdash;or old or young,&mdash;
     The living libel of a slanderous tongue!
     So shall my theme as far contrasted be,
     As saints by fiends, or hymns by calumny.
     Come, gentle Amoret (for 'neath that name,
     In worthier verse is sung thy beauty's fame);
     Come&mdash;for but thee who seeks the Muse? and while
     Celestial blushes check thy conscious smile,
     With timid grace, and hesitating eye,
     The perfect model, which I boast, supply:&mdash;
     Vain Muse! couldst thou the humblest sketch create
     Of her, or slightest charm couldst imitate&mdash;
     Could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace
     The faintest wonder of her form and face&mdash;
     Poets would study the immortal line,
     And REYNOLDS own HIS art subdued by thine;
     That art, which well might added lustre give
     To Nature's best and Heaven's superlative:
     On GRANBY'S cheek might bid new glories rise,
     Or point a purer beam from DEVON'S eyes!
     Hard is the task to shape that beauty's praise,
     Whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays!
     But praising Amoret we cannot err,
     No tongue o'ervalues Heaven, or flatters her!
     Yet she, by Fate's perverseness&mdash;she alone
     Would doubt our truth, nor deem such praise her own!
     Adorning Fashion, unadorn'd by dress,
     Simple from taste, and not from carelessness;
     Discreet in gesture, in deportment mild,
     Not stiff with prudence, nor uncouthly wild:
     No state has AMORET! no studied mien;
     She frowns no GODDESS, and she moves no QUEEN.
     The softer charm that in her manner lies
     Is framed to captivate, yet not surprise;
     It justly suits th' expression of her face,&mdash;
     'Tis less than dignity, and more than grace!
     On her pure cheek the native hue is such,
     That, form'd by Heav'n to be admired so much,
     The hand divine, with a less partial care,
     Might well have fix'd a fainter crimson there,
     And bade the gentle inmate of her breast,&mdash;
     Inshrined Modesty!&mdash;supply the rest.
     But who the peril of her lips shall paint?
     Strip them of smiles&mdash;still, still all words are faint!
     But moving Love himself appears to teach
     Their action, though denied to rule her speech;
     And thou who seest her speak and dost not hear,
     Mourn not her distant accents 'scape thine ear;
     Viewing those lips, thou still may'st make pretence
     To judge of what she says, and swear 'tis sense:
     Cloth'd with such grace, with such expression fraught,
     They move in meaning, and they pause in thought!
     But dost thou farther watch, with charm'd surprise,
     The mild irresolution of her eyes,
     Curious to mark how frequent they repose,
     In brief eclipse and momentary close&mdash;
     Ah! seest thou not an ambush'd Cupid there,
     Too tim'rous of his charge, with jealous care
     Veils and unveils those beams of heav'nly light,
     Too full, too fatal else, for mortal sight?
     Nor yet, such pleasing vengeance fond to meet,
     In pard'ning dimples hope a safe retreat.
     What though her peaceful breast should ne'er allow
     Subduing frowns to arm her altered brow,
     By Love, I swear, and by his gentle wiles,
     More fatal still the mercy of her smiles!
     Thus lovely, thus adorn'd, possessing all
     Of bright or fair that can to woman fall,
     The height of vanity might well be thought
     Prerogative in her, and Nature's fault.
     Yet gentle AMORET, in mind supreme
     As well as charms, rejects the vainer theme;
     And, half mistrustful of her beauty's store,
     She barbs with wit those darts too keen before:&mdash;
     Read in all knowledge that her sex should reach,
     Though GREVILLE, or the MUSE, should deign to teach,
     Fond to improve, nor tim'rous to discern
     How far it is a woman's grace to learn;
     In MILLAR'S dialect she would not prove
     Apollo's priestess, but Apollo's love,
     Graced by those signs which truth delights to own,
     The timid blush, and mild submitted tone:
     Whate'er she says, though sense appear throughout,
     Displays the tender hue of female doubt;
     Deck'd with that charm, how lovely wit appears,
     How graceful SCIENCE, when that robe she wears!
     Such too her talents, and her bent of mind,
     As speak a sprightly heart by thought refined:
     A taste for mirth, by contemplation school'd,
     A turn for ridicule, by candour ruled,
     A scorn of folly, which she tries to hide;
     An awe of talent, which she owns with pride!
       Peace, idle Muse! no more thy strain prolong,
     But yield a theme thy warmest praises wrong;
     Just to her merit, though thou canst not raise
     Thy feeble verse, behold th' acknowledged praise
     Has spread conviction through the envious train,
     And cast a fatal gloom o'er Scandal's reign!
     And lo! each pallid hag, with blister'd tongue,
     Mutters assent to all thy zeal has sung&mdash;
     Owns all the colours just&mdash;the outline true;
     Thee my inspirer, and my MODEL&mdash;CREWE!

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE WRITTEN BY MR. GARRICK
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A school for Scandal! tell me, I beseech you,
     Needs there a school this modish art to teach you?
     No need of lessons now, the knowing think;
     We might as well be taught to eat and drink.
     Caused by a dearth of scandal, should the vapours
     Distress our fair ones&mdash;let them read the papers;
     Their powerful mixtures such disorders hit;
     Crave what you will&mdash;there's quantum sufficit.
     "Lord!" cries my Lady Wormwood (who loves tattle,
     And puts much salt and pepper in her prattle),
     Just risen at noon, all night at cards when threshing
     Strong tea and scandal&mdash;"Bless me, how refreshing!
     Give me the papers, Lisp&mdash;how bold and free!  [Sips.]
     LAST NIGHT LORD L. [Sips] WAS CAUGHT WITH LADY D.
     For aching heads what charming sal volatile!  [Sips.]
     IF MRS. B. WILL STILL CONTINUE FLIRTING,
     WE HOPE SHE'LL draw, OR WE'LL undraw THE CURTAIN.
     Fine satire, poz&mdash;in public all abuse it,
     But, by ourselves [Sips], our praise we can't refuse it.
     Now, Lisp, read you&mdash;there, at that dash and star:"
     "Yes, ma'am&mdash;A CERTAIN LORD HAD BEST BEWARE,
     WHO LIVES NOT TWENTY MILES FROM GROSVENOR SQUARE;
     FOR, SHOULD HE LADY W. FIND WILLING,
     WORMWOOD IS BITTER"&mdash;&mdash;"Oh! that's me! the villain!
     Throw it behind the fire, and never more
     Let that vile paper come within my door."
     Thus at our friends we laugh, who feel the dart;
     To reach our feelings, we ourselves must smart.
     Is our young bard so young, to think that he
     Can stop the full spring-tide of calumny?
     Knows he the world so little, and its trade?
     Alas! the devil's sooner raised than laid.
     So strong, so swift, the monster there's no gagging:
     Cut Scandal's head off, still the tongue is wagging.
     Proud of your smiles once lavishly bestow'd,
     Again our young Don Quixote takes the road;
     To show his gratitude he draws his pen,
     And seeks his hydra, Scandal, in his den.
     For your applause all perils he would through&mdash;
     He'll fight&mdash;that's write&mdash;a cavalliero true,
     Till every drop of blood&mdash;that's ink&mdash;is spilt for you.

      SCENE I.&mdash;LADY SNEERWELL'S House
    </h2>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET; MISS VERJUICE drinking
      chocolate
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. They were Madam&mdash;and as I copied them myself in a feigned
      Hand there can be no suspicion whence they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle's Intrigue
      with Captain Boastall?
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the Town&mdash;and
      I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain
      Baronet's Lady and a certain Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told
      the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it
      directly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a
      Milliners' Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose
      sister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit&mdash;so that in the
      common course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit's Ears within
      four-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Why truly Mrs. Clackit has a very pretty Talent&mdash;a
      great deal of industry&mdash;yet&mdash;yes&mdash;been tolerably successful
      in her way&mdash;To my knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off
      six matches[,] of three sons being disinherited and four Daughters being
      turned out of Doors. Of three several Elopements, as many close
      confinements&mdash;nine separate maintenances and two Divorces.&mdash;nay
      I have more than once traced her causing a Tete-a-Tete in the Town and
      Country Magazine&mdash;when the Parties perhaps had never seen each
      other's Faces before in the course of their Lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. She certainly has Talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. But her manner is gross.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She generally designs well[,] has a free tongue
      and a bold invention&mdash;but her colouring is too dark and her outline
      often extravagant&mdash;She wants that delicacy of Tint&mdash;and
      mellowness of sneer&mdash;which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Ah you are Partial Verjuice.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Not in the least&mdash;everybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can
      do more with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail
      even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Yes my dear Verjuice. I am no Hypocrite to deny the
      satisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts. Wounded myself, in the
      early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess I have
      since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level of my
      own injured Reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Nothing can be more natural&mdash;But my dear Lady Sneerwell
      There is one affair in which you have lately employed me, wherein, I
      confess I am at a Loss to guess your motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour, Sir
      Peter Teazle, and his Family&mdash;Lappet.&mdash;And has my conduct in
      this matter really appeared to you so mysterious?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit MAID.]
</pre>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Entirely so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. [VERJUICE.?] An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was[,] having
      taken a young wife from out of the Country&mdash;as Lady Teazle is&mdash;are
      certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery&mdash;but here
      are two young men&mdash;to whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian
      since their Father's death, the eldest possessing the most amiable
      Character and universally well spoken of[,] the youngest the most
      dissipated and extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom, without Friends or
      caracter&mdash;the former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently
      your Favourite[,] the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward&mdash;and
      confessedly beloved by her. Now on the face of these circumstances it is
      utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great jointure&mdash;should
      not close with the passion of a man of such character and expectations as
      Mr. Surface&mdash;and more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest to
      destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between his Brother Charles and
      Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Then at once to unravel this mistery&mdash;I must inform
      you that Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr. Surface
      and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortune&mdash;but
      finding in his Brother a favoured Rival, He has been obliged to mask his
      Pretensions&mdash;and profit by my Assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself in
      his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Heavens! how dull you are! cannot you surmise the weakness
      which I hitherto, thro' shame have concealed even from you&mdash;must I
      confess that Charles&mdash;that Libertine, that extravagant, that Bankrupt
      in Fortune and Reputation&mdash;that He it is for whom I am thus anxious
      and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice&mdash;everything&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Now indeed&mdash;your conduct appears consistent and I no longer
      wonder at your enmity to Maria, but how came you and Surface so
      confidential?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. For our mutual interest&mdash;but I have found out him a
      long time since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside&mdash;I
      know him to be artful selfish and malicious&mdash;while with Sir Peter,
      and indeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of
      Prudence&mdash;good sense and Benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Yes yes&mdash;I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in
      England; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. True and with the assistance of his sentiments and
      hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with respect
      to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle into the
      same good opinion towards him&mdash;while poor Charles has no Friend in
      the House&mdash;though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart,
      against whom we must direct our schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANT. Mr. Surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Shew him up. He generally calls about this Time. I don't
      wonder at People's giving him to me for a Lover.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter SURFACE
</pre>
    <p>
      SURFACE. My dear Lady Sneerwell, how do you do to-day&mdash;your most
      obedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Miss Verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual
      attachment now; but I have informed her of our real views and the Purposes
      for which our Geniuses at present co-operate. You know how useful she has
      been to us&mdash;and believe me the confidence is not ill-placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Madam, it is impossible for me to suspect that a Lady of Miss
      Verjuice's sensibility and discernment&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Well&mdash;well&mdash;no compliments now&mdash;but tell me
      when you saw your mistress or what is more material to me your Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. I have not seen either since I saw you&mdash;but I can inform you
      that they are at present at Variance&mdash;some of your stories have taken
      good effect on Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Ah! my dear Verjuice the merit of this belongs to you. But
      do your Brother's Distresses encrease?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Every hour. I am told He had another execution in his house
      yesterday&mdash;in short his Dissipation and extravagance exceed anything
      I have ever heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Poor Charles!
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. True Madam&mdash;notwithstanding his Vices one can't help feeling
      for him&mdash;ah poor Charles! I'm sure I wish it was in my Power to be of
      any essential Service to him&mdash;for the man who does not share in the
      Distresses of a Brother&mdash;even though merited by his own misconduct&mdash;deserves&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. O Lud you are going to be moral, and forget that you are
      among Friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Egad, that's true&mdash;I'll keep that sentiment till I see Sir
      Peter. However it is certainly a charity to rescue Maria from such a
      Libertine who&mdash;if He is to be reclaim'd, can be so only by a Person
      of your Ladyship's superior accomplishments and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. 'Twould be a Hazardous experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. But&mdash;Madam&mdash;let me caution you to place no more
      confidence in our Friend Snake the Libeller&mdash;I have lately detected
      him in frequent conference with old Rowland [Rowley] who was formerly my
      Father's Steward and has never been a friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I'm not disappointed in Snake, I never suspected the
      fellow to have virtue enough to be faithful even to his own Villany.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter MARIA
</pre>
    <p>
      Maria my dear&mdash;how do you do&mdash;what's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. O here is that disagreeable lover of mine, Sir Benjamin Backbite,
      has just call'd at my guardian's with his odious Uncle Crabtree&mdash;so I
      slipt out and ran hither to avoid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Is that all?
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Lady Sneerwell&mdash;I'll go and write the Letter I mention'd to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. If my Brother Charles had been of the Party, madam, perhaps you
      would not have been so much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nay now&mdash;you are severe for I dare swear the Truth of
      the matter is Maria heard YOU were here&mdash;but my dear&mdash;what has
      Sir Benjamin done that you should avoid him so&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Oh He has done nothing&mdash;but his conversation is a perpetual
      Libel on all his Acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Aye and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing
      Them, for He'll abuse a stranger just as soon as his best Friend&mdash;and
      Crabtree is as bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nay but we should make allowance[&mdash;]Sir Benjamin is a
      wit and a poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. For my Part&mdash;I own madam&mdash;wit loses its respect with me,
      when I see it in company with malice.&mdash;What do you think, Mr.
      Surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Certainly, Madam, to smile at the jest which plants a Thorn on
      another's Breast is to become a principal in the mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Pshaw&mdash;there's no possibility of being witty without
      a little [ill] nature&mdash;the malice of a good thing is the Barb that
      makes it stick.&mdash;What's your opinion, Mr. Surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Certainly madam&mdash;that conversation where the Spirit of
      Raillery is suppressed will ever appear tedious and insipid&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Well I'll not debate how far Scandal may be allowable&mdash;but in
      a man I am sure it is always contemtable.&mdash;We have Pride, envy,
      Rivalship, and a Thousand motives to depreciate each other&mdash;but the
      male-slanderer must have the cowardice of a woman before He can traduce
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I wish my Cousin Verjuice hadn't left us&mdash;she should
      embrace you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Ah! she's an old maid and is privileged of course.

      Madam Mrs. Candour is below and if your Ladyship's at leisure will leave

    <p>
      MARIA. Yes with a very gross affectation of good Nature and Benevolence&mdash;she
      does more mischief than the Direct malice of old Crabtree.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Efaith 'tis very true Lady Sneerwell&mdash;Whenever I hear the
      current running again the characters of my Friends, I never think them in
      such Danger as when Candour undertakes their Defence.

</pre>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. My dear Lady Sneerwell how have you been this Century. I
      have never seen you tho' I have heard of you very often.&mdash;Mr. Surface&mdash;the
      World says scandalous things of you&mdash;but indeed it is no matter what
      the world says, for I think one hears nothing else but scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Just so, indeed, Ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Ah Maria Child&mdash;what[!] is the whole affair off between
      you and Charles? His extravagance; I presume&mdash;The Town talks of
      nothing else&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. I am very sorry, Ma'am, the Town has so little to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. True, true, Child; but there's no stopping people's Tongues.
      I own I was hurt to hear it&mdash;as I indeed was to learn from the same
      quarter that your guardian, Sir Peter[,] and Lady Teazle have not agreed
      lately so well as could be wish'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. 'Tis strangely impertinent for people to busy themselves so.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Very true, Child; but what's to be done? People will talk&mdash;there's
      no preventing it.&mdash;why it was but yesterday I was told that Miss
      Gadabout had eloped with Sir Filagree Flirt. But, Lord! there is no
      minding what one hears; tho' to be sure I had this from very good
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Such reports are highly scandalous.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. So they are Child&mdash;shameful! shameful! but the world is
      so censorious no character escapes. Lord, now! who would have suspected
      your friend, Miss Prim, of an indiscretion Yet such is the ill-nature of
      people, that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was
      stepping into a Postchaise with her Dancing-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. I'll answer for't there are no grounds for the Report.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Oh, no foundation in the world I dare swear[;] no more
      probably than for the story circulated last month, of Mrs. Festino's
      affair with Colonel Cassino&mdash;tho' to be sure that matter was never
      rightly clear'd up.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. The license of invention some people take is monstrous indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. 'Tis so but in my opinion, those who report such things are equally
      culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. To be sure they are[;] Tale Bearers are as bad as the Tale
      makers&mdash;'tis an old observation and a very true one&mdash;but what's
      to be done as I said before&mdash;how will you prevent People from talking&mdash;to-day,
      Mrs. Clackitt assured me, Mr. and Mrs. Honeymoon were at last become mere
      man and wife&mdash;like [the rest of their] acquaintance&mdash;she
      likewise hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her
      Dropsy and recovered her shape in a most surprising manner&mdash;at the
      same [time] Miss Tattle, who was by affirm'd, that Lord Boffalo had
      discover'd his Lady at a house of no extraordinary Fame&mdash;and that Sir
      Harry Bouquet and Tom Saunter were to measure swords on a similar
      Provocation. But&mdash;Lord! do you think I would report these Things&mdash;No,
      no[!] Tale Bearers as I said before are just as bad as the talemakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Ah! Mrs. Candour, if everybody had your Forbearance and good
      nature&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I confess Mr. Surface I cannot bear to hear People traduced
      behind their Backs[;] and when ugly circumstances come out against our
      acquaintances I own I always love to think the best&mdash;by the bye I
      hope 'tis not true that your Brother is absolutely ruin'd&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. I am afraid his circumstances are very bad indeed, Ma'am&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Ah! I heard so&mdash;but you must tell him to keep up his
      Spirits&mdash;everybody almost is in the same way&mdash;Lord Spindle, Sir
      Thomas Splint, Captain Quinze, and Mr. Nickit&mdash;all up, I hear, within

    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Ask Sir Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. 'Tis very true, Ma'am&mdash;everything is fixed and the
      wedding Livery bespoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes and they say there were pressing reasons for't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. It cannot be&mdash;and I wonder any one should believe such
      a story of so prudent a Lady as Miss Nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. O Lud! ma'am, that's the very reason 'twas believed at once.
      She has always been so cautious and so reserved, that everybody was sure
      there was some reason for it at bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Yes a Tale of Scandal is as fatal to the Reputation of a
      prudent Lady of her stamp as a Fever is generally to those of the
      strongest Constitutions, but there is a sort of puny sickly Reputation,
      that is always ailing yet will outlive the robuster characters of a
      hundred Prudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. True Madam there are Valetudinarians in Reputation as well
      as constitution&mdash;who being conscious of their weak Part, avoid the
      least breath of air, and supply their want of Stamina by care and
      circumspection&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Well but this may be all mistake&mdash;You know, Sir
      Benjamin very trifling circumstances often give rise to the most injurious
      Tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. That they do I'll be sworn Ma'am&mdash;did you ever hear how
      Miss Shepherd came to lose her Lover and her Character last summer at
      Tunbridge&mdash;Sir Benjamin you remember it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. O to be sure the most whimsical circumstance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. How was it Pray&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Why one evening at Mrs. Ponto's Assembly&mdash;the conversation
      happened to turn on the difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia Sheep in this
      country&mdash;says a young Lady in company[, "]I have known instances of
      it[&mdash;]for Miss Letitia Shepherd, a first cousin of mine, had a
      Nova-Scotia Sheep that produced her Twins.["&mdash;"]What!["] cries the
      old Dowager Lady Dundizzy (who you know is as deaf as a Post), ["]has Miss
      Letitia Shepherd had twins["]&mdash;This Mistake&mdash;as you may imagine,
      threw the whole company into a fit of Laughing&mdash;However 'twas the
      next morning everywhere reported and in a few Days believed by the whole
      Town, that Miss Letitia Shepherd had actually been brought to Bed of a
      fine Boy and Girl&mdash;and in less than a week there were People who
      could name the Father, and the Farm House where the Babies were put out to
      Nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Strange indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Matter of Fact, I assure you&mdash;O Lud! Mr. Surface pray is it
      true that your uncle Sir Oliver is coming home&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Not that I know of indeed Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. He has been in the East Indies a long time&mdash;you can
      scarcely remember him&mdash;I believe&mdash;sad comfort on his arrival to
      hear how your Brother has gone on!
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Charles has been imprudent Sir to be sure[;] but I hope no Busy
      people have already prejudiced Sir Oliver against him&mdash;He may reform&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. To be sure He may&mdash;for my Part I never believed him to
      be so utterly void of Principle as People say&mdash;and tho' he has lost
      all his Friends I am told nobody is better spoken of&mdash;by the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. That's true egad nephew&mdash;if the Old Jewry was a Ward I
      believe Charles would be an alderman&mdash;no man more popular there,
      'fore Gad I hear He pays as many annuities as the Irish Tontine and that
      whenever He's sick they have Prayers for the recovery of his Health in the
      synagogue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Yet no man lives in greater Splendour:&mdash;they tell me
      when He entertains his Friends&mdash;He can sit down to dinner with a
      dozen of his own Securities, have a score Tradesmen waiting in the
      Anti-Chamber, and an officer behind every guest's Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. This may be entertainment to you Gentlemen but you pay very
      little regard to the Feelings of a Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Their malice is intolerable&mdash;Lady Sneerwell I must wish you a
      good morning&mdash;I'm not very well.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit MARIA.]

    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. O dear she chang'd colour very much!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Do Mrs. Candour follow her&mdash;she may want assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. That I will with all my soul ma'am.&mdash;Poor dear Girl&mdash;who
      knows&mdash;what her situation may be!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit MRS. CANDOUR.]
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. 'Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear Charles
      reflected on notwithstanding their difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. The young Lady's Penchant is obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. But Benjamin&mdash;you mustn't give up the Pursuit for that&mdash;follow
      her and put her into good humour&mdash;repeat her some of your verses&mdash;come,
      I'll assist you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Mr. Surface I did not mean to hurt you&mdash;but depend on't
      your Brother is utterly undone&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Going.]

      a guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. And everything sold&mdash;I'm told&mdash;that was movable&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Going.]
</pre>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. I was at his house&mdash;not a thing left but some empty Bottles
      that were overlooked and the Family Pictures, which I believe are framed
      in the Wainscot.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Going.]

      than Maria.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter SIR PETER
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. When an old Bachelor takes a young Wife&mdash;what is He to
      expect&mdash;'Tis now six months since Lady Teazle made me the happiest of
      men&mdash;and I have been the most miserable Dog ever since that ever
      committed wedlock. We tift a little going to church&mdash;and came to a
      Quarrel before the Bells had done ringing&mdash;I was more than once
      nearly chok'd with gall during the Honeymoon&mdash;and had lost all
      comfort in Life before my Friends had done wishing me Joy&mdash;yet I
      chose with caution&mdash;a girl bred wholly in the country&mdash;who never
      knew luxury beyond one silk gown&mdash;nor dissipation above the annual
      Gala of a Race-Ball&mdash;Yet she now plays her Part in all the
      extravagant Fopperies of the Fashion and the Town, with as ready a Grace
      as if she had never seen a Bush nor a grass Plot out of Grosvenor-Square!
      I am sneered at by my old acquaintance&mdash;paragraphed&mdash;in the news
      Papers&mdash;She dissipates my Fortune, and contradicts all my Humours&mdash;yet
      the worst of it is I doubt I love her or I should never bear all this.
      However I'll never be weak enough to own it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter ROWLEY
</pre>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Sir Peter, your servant:&mdash;how is 't with you Sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Very bad&mdash;Master Rowley&mdash;very bad[.] I meet with
      nothing but crosses and vexations&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. What can have happened to trouble you since yesterday?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. A good&mdash;question to a married man&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Nay I'm sure your Lady Sir Peter can't be the cause of your
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Why has anybody told you she was dead[?]
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Come, come, Sir Peter, you love her, notwithstanding your tempers
      do not exactly agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. But the Fault is entirely hers, Master Rowley&mdash;I am
      myself, the sweetest temper'd man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and so
      I tell her a hundred Times a day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye and what is very extraordinary in all our disputes she is
      always in the wrong! But Lady Sneerwell, and the Set she meets at her
      House, encourage the perverseness of her Disposition&mdash;then to
      complete my vexations&mdash;Maria&mdash;my Ward&mdash;whom I ought to have
      the Power of a Father over, is determined to turn Rebel too and absolutely
      refuses the man whom I have long resolved on for her husband&mdash;meaning
      I suppose, to bestow herself on his profligate Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. You know Sir Peter I have always taken the Liberty to differ with
      you on the subject of these two young Gentlemen&mdash;I only wish you may
      not be deceived in your opinion of the elder. For Charles, my life on't!
      He will retrieve his errors yet&mdash;their worthy Father, once my
      honour'd master, was at his years nearly as wild a spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. You are wrong, Master Rowley&mdash;on their Father's Death you
      know I acted as a kind of Guardian to them both&mdash;till their uncle Sir
      Oliver's Eastern Bounty gave them an early independence. Of course no
      person could have more opportunities of judging of their Hearts&mdash;and
      I was never mistaken in my life. Joseph is indeed a model for the young
      men of the Age&mdash;He is a man of Sentiment&mdash;and acts up to the
      Sentiments he professes&mdash;but for the other[,] take my word for't [if]
      he had any grain of Virtue by descent&mdash;he has dissipated it with the
      rest of his inheritance. Ah! my old Friend, Sir Oliver will be deeply
      mortified when he finds how Part of his Bounty has been misapplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. I am sorry to find you so violent against the young man because
      this may be the most critical Period of his Fortune. I came hither with
      news that will surprise you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. What! let me hear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Sir Oliver is arrived and at this moment in Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. How!&mdash;you astonish me&mdash;I thought you did not expect
      him this month!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. I did not&mdash;but his Passage has been remarkably quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Egad I shall rejoice to see my old Friend&mdash;'Tis sixteen
      years since we met&mdash;We have had many a Day together&mdash;but does he
      still enjoin us not to inform his Nephews of his Arrival?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Most strictly&mdash;He means, before He makes it known to make
      some trial of their Dispositions and we have already planned something for
      the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah there needs no art to discover their merits&mdash;however he
      shall have his way&mdash;but pray does he know I am married!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Yes and will soon wish you joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. You may tell him 'tis too late&mdash;ah Oliver will laugh at me&mdash;we
      used to rail at matrimony together&mdash;but He has been steady to his
      Text&mdash;well He must be at my house tho'&mdash;I'll instantly give
      orders for his Reception&mdash;but Master Rowley&mdash;don't drop a word
      that Lady Teazle and I ever disagree.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. By no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. For I should never be able to stand Noll's jokes; so I'd have
      him think that we are a very happy couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. I understand you&mdash;but then you must be very careful not to
      differ while He's in the House with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Egad&mdash;and so we must&mdash;that's impossible. Ah! Master
      Rowley when an old Batchelor marries a young wife&mdash;He deserves&mdash;no
      the crime carries the Punishment along with it.

      SCENE I.&mdash;SIR PETER and LADY TEAZLE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SIR PETER. Lady Teazle&mdash;Lady Teazle I'll not bear it.
    </h3>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Sir Peter&mdash;Sir Peter you&mdash;may scold or smile,
      according to your Humour[,] but I ought to have my own way in everything,
      and what's more I will too&mdash;what! tho' I was educated in the country
      I know very well that women of Fashion in London are accountable to nobody
      after they are married.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Very well! ma'am very well! so a husband is to have no
      influence, no authority?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Authority! no, to be sure&mdash;if you wanted authority over
      me, you should have adopted me and not married me[:] I am sure you were
      old enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Old enough&mdash;aye there it is&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;Lady
      Teazle, tho' my life may be made unhappy by your Temper&mdash;I'll not be
      ruined by your extravagance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a
      woman of Fashion ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No no Madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such
      unmeaning Luxury&mdash;'Slife to spend as much to furnish your Dressing
      Room with Flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon into a
      Greenhouse, and give a Fete Champetre at Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Lord! Sir Peter am I to blame because Flowers are dear in
      cold weather? You should find fault with the Climate, and not with me. For
      my Part I'm sure I wish it was spring all the year round&mdash;and that
      Roses grew under one's Feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Oons! Madam&mdash;if you had been born to those Fopperies I
      shouldn't wonder at your talking thus;&mdash;but you forget what your
      situation was when I married you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No, no, I don't&mdash;'twas a very disagreeable one or I
      should never nave married you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler Style&mdash;the
      daughter of a plain country Squire. Recollect Lady Teazle when I saw you
      first&mdash;sitting at your tambour in a pretty figured linen gown&mdash;with
      a Bunch of Keys at your side, and your apartment hung round with Fruits in
      worsted, of your own working&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. O horrible!&mdash;horrible!&mdash;don't put me in mind of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, yes Madam and your daily occupation to inspect the Dairy,
      superintend the Poultry, make extracts from the Family Receipt-book, and
      comb your aunt Deborah's Lap Dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Abominable!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes Madam&mdash;and what were your evening amusements? to draw
      Patterns for Ruffles, which you hadn't the materials to make&mdash;play
      Pope Joan with the Curate&mdash;to read a sermon to your Aunt&mdash;or be
      stuck down to an old Spinet to strum your father to sleep after a Fox
      Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Scandalous&mdash;Sir Peter not a word of it true&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, Madam&mdash;These were the recreations I took you from&mdash;and
      now&mdash;no one more extravagantly in the Fashion&mdash;Every Fopery
      adopted&mdash;a head-dress to o'er top Lady Pagoda with feathers pendant
      horizontal and perpendicular&mdash;you forget[,] Lady Teazle&mdash;when a
      little wired gauze with a few Beads made you a fly Cap not much bigger
      than a blew-bottle, and your Hair was comb'd smooth over a Roll&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Shocking! horrible Roll!!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. But now&mdash;you must have your coach&mdash;Vis-a-vis, and
      three powder'd Footmen before your Chair&mdash;and in the summer a pair of
      white cobs to draw you to Kensington Gardens&mdash;no recollection when y
      ou were content to ride double, behind the Butler, on a docked
      Coach-Horse?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Horrid!&mdash;I swear I never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. This, madam, was your situation&mdash;and what have I not done
      for you? I have made you woman of Fashion of Fortune of Rank&mdash;in
      short I have made you my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Well then and there is but one thing more you can make me to
      add to the obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. What's that pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Your widow.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Thank you Madam&mdash;but don't flatter yourself for though
      your ill-conduct may disturb my Peace it shall never break my Heart I
      promise you&mdash;however I am equally obliged to you for the Hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Then why will you endeavour to make yourself so disagreeable
      to me&mdash;and thwart me in every little elegant expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. 'Slife&mdash;Madam I pray, had you any of these elegant
      expenses when you married me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Lud Sir Peter would you have me be out of the Fashion?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. The Fashion indeed!&mdash;what had you to do with the Fashion
      before you married me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. For my Part&mdash;I should think you would like to have your
      wife thought a woman of Taste&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye there again&mdash;Taste! Zounds Madam you had no Taste when
      you married me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. That's very true indeed Sir Peter! after having married you I
      should never pretend to Taste again I allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. So&mdash;so then&mdash;Madam&mdash;if these are your Sentiments
      pray how came I to be honour'd with your Hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Shall I tell you the Truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. If it's not too great a Favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Why the Fact is I was tired of all those agreeable
      Recreations which you have so good naturally [naturedly] Described&mdash;and
      having a Spirit to spend and enjoy a Fortune&mdash;I determined to marry
      the first rich man that would have me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. A very honest confession&mdash;truly&mdash;but pray madam was
      there no one else you might have tried to ensnare but me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. O lud&mdash;I drew my net at several but you were the only
      one I could catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. This is plain dealing indeed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. But now Sir Peter if we have finish'd our daily Jangle I
      presume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye&mdash;there's another Precious circumstance&mdash;a
      charming set of acquaintance&mdash;you have made there!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Nay Sir Peter they are People of Rank and Fortune&mdash;and
      remarkably tenacious of reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes egad they are tenacious of Reputation with a vengeance, for
      they don't chuse anybody should have a Character but themselves! Such a
      crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on hurdles who has done less mischief than
      these utterers of forged Tales, coiners of Scandal, and clippers of
      Reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. What would you restrain the freedom of speech?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye they have made you just as bad [as] any one of the Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Why&mdash;I believe I do bear a Part with a tolerable Grace&mdash;But
      I vow I bear no malice against the People I abuse, when I say an
      ill-natured thing, 'tis out of pure Good Humour&mdash;and I take it for
      granted they deal exactly in the same manner with me, but Sir Peter you
      know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well well I'll call in, just to look after my own character.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Then, indeed, you must make Haste after me, or you'll be too
      late&mdash;so good bye to ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. So&mdash;I have gain'd much by my intended expostulation&mdash;yet
      with what a charming air she contradicts every thing I say&mdash;and how
      pleasingly she shows her contempt of my authority&mdash;Well tho' I can't
      make her love me, there is certainly a great satisfaction in quarrelling
      with her; and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is
      doing everything in her Power to plague me.

      SCENE II.&mdash;At LADY SNEERWELL'S
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LADY SNEERWELL, MRS. CANDOUR, CRABTREE, SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE,
     and SURFACE
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nay, positively, we will hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Yes&mdash;yes the Epigram by all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      SiR BENJAMIN. O plague on't unkle&mdash;'tis mere nonsense&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. No no; 'fore gad very clever for an extempore!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. But ladies you should be acquainted with the circumstances.
      You must know that one day last week as Lady Betty Curricle was taking the
      Dust in High Park, in a sort of duodecimo Phaeton&mdash;she desired me to
      write some verses on her Ponies&mdash;upon which I took out my Pocket-Book&mdash;and
      in one moment produced&mdash;the following:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'Sure never were seen two such beautiful Ponies;
   Other Horses are Clowns&mdash;and these macaronies,
   Nay to give 'em this Title, I'm sure isn't wrong,
   Their Legs are so slim&mdash;and their Tails are so long.
</pre>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. There Ladies&mdash;done in the smack of a whip and on Horseback
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. A very Phoebus, mounted&mdash;indeed Sir Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Oh dear Sir&mdash;Trifles&mdash;Trifles.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter LADY TEAZLE and MARIA
</pre>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I must have a Copy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Lady Teazle&mdash;I hope we shall see Sir Peter?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I believe He'll wait on your Ladyship presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Maria my love you look grave. Come, you sit down to Piquet
      with Mr. Surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. I take very little Pleasure in cards&mdash;however, I'll do as you
      Please.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I am surprised Mr. Surface should sit down her&mdash;I
      thought He would have embraced this opportunity of speaking to me before
      Sir Peter came&mdash;[Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Now, I'll die but you are so scandalous I'll forswear your
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. What's the matter, Mrs. Candour?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. They'll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Oh, surely she is a pretty woman. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      [CRABTREE.] I am very glad you think so ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. She has a charming fresh Colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes when it is fresh put on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. O fie! I'll swear her colour is natural&mdash;I have seen it
      come and go&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. I dare swear you have, ma'am: it goes of a Night, and comes
      again in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. True, uncle, it not only comes and goes but what's more egad
      her maid can fetch and carry it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so! But surely, now,
      her Sister, is or was very handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Who? Mrs. Stucco? O lud! she's six-and-fifty if she's an hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Now positively you wrong her[;] fifty-two, or fifty-three is
      the utmost&mdash;and I don't think she looks more.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! there's no judging by her looks, unless one was to see
      her Face.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Well&mdash;well&mdash;if she does take some pains to
      repair the ravages of Time&mdash;you must allow she effects it with great
      ingenuity&mdash;and surely that's better than the careless manner in which
      the widow Ocre chaulks her wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Nay now&mdash;you are severe upon the widow&mdash;come&mdash;come,
      it isn't that she paints so ill&mdash;but when she has finished her Face
      she joins it on so badly to her Neck, that she looks like a mended Statue,
      in which the Connoisseur sees at once that the Head's modern tho' the
      Trunk's antique&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Nephew!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh but I vow I hate you for
      it&mdash;what do you think of Miss Simper?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Why, she has very pretty Teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Yes and on that account, when she is neither speaking nor
      laughing (which very seldom happens)&mdash;she never absolutely shuts her
      mouth, but leaves it always on a-Jar, as it were&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. How can you be so ill-natured!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Nay, I allow even that's better than the Pains Mrs. Prim
      takes to conceal her losses in Front&mdash;she draws her mouth till it
      resembles the aperture of a Poor's-Box, and all her words appear to slide
      out edgewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Very well Lady Teazle I see you can be a little severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. In defence of a Friend it is but justice, but here comes Sir
      Peter to spoil our Pleasantry.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter SIR PETER
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ladies, your obedient&mdash;Mercy on me&mdash;here is the whole
      set! a character's dead at every word, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter&mdash;they have been
      so censorious and Lady Teazle as bad as any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. That must be very distressing to you, Mrs. Candour I dare
      swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. O they will allow good Qualities to nobody&mdash;not even
      good nature to our Friend Mrs. Pursy.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs. Codrille's
      [Quadrille's] last Night?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nay&mdash;her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes
      such Pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. 'Tis very true, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and small whey&mdash;laces
      herself by pulleys and often in the hottest noon of summer you may see her
      on a little squat Pony, with her hair plaited up behind like a Drummer's
      and puffing round the Ring on a full trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I thank you Lady Teazle for defending her.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, a good Defence, truly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. But for Sir Benjamin, He is as censorious as Miss Sallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes and she is a curious Being to pretend to be censorious&mdash;an
      awkward Gawky, without any one good Point under Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss Sallow is
      a Relation of mine by marriage, and, as for her Person great allowance is
      to be made&mdash;for, let me tell you a woman labours under many
      disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl at six-and-thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Tho', surely she is handsome still&mdash;and for the
      weakness in her eyes considering how much she reads by candle-light it is
      not to be wonder'd at.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. True and then as to her manner&mdash;upon my word I think
      it is particularly graceful considering she never had the least
      Education[:] for you know her Mother was a Welch milliner, and her Father
      a sugar-Baker at Bristow.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, damned good-natured! Her own relation! mercy on me!
      [Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. For my Part I own I cannot bear to hear a friend ill-spoken
      of?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Ah you are of a moral turn Mrs. Candour and can sit for an
      hour to hear Lady Stucco talk sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nay I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the Dessert after
      Dinner for she's just like the Spanish Fruit one cracks for mottoes&mdash;made
      up of Paint and Proverb.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Well, I never will join in ridiculing a Friend&mdash;and so
      I constantly tell my cousin Ogle&mdash;and you all know what pretensions
      she has to be critical in Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. O to be sure she has herself the oddest countenance that ever
      was seen&mdash;'tis a collection of Features from all the different
      Countries of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. So she has indeed&mdash;an Irish Front&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Caledonian Locks&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Dutch Nose&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Austrian Lips&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Complexion of a Spaniard&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. And Teeth a la Chinoise&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. In short, her Face resembles a table d'hote at Spa&mdash;where
      no two guests are of a nation&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Or a Congress at the close of a general War&mdash;wherein all
      the members even to her eyes appear to have a different interest and her
      Nose and Chin are the only Parties likely to join issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Mercy on my Life[!] a Person they dine with twice a week!
      [Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Go&mdash;go&mdash;you are a couple of provoking Toads.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Nay but I vow you shall not carry the Laugh off so&mdash;for
      give me leave to say, that Mrs. Ogle&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Madam&mdash;madam&mdash;I beg your Pardon&mdash;there's no
      stopping these good Gentlemen's Tongues&mdash;but when I tell you Mrs.
      Candour that the Lady they are abusing is a particular Friend of mine, I
      hope you'll not take her Part.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter&mdash;but you are a cruel
      creature&mdash;too Phlegmatic yourself for a jest and too peevish to allow
      wit in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah Madam true wit is more nearly allow'd [allied?] to good
      Nature than your Ladyship is aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. True Sir Peter&mdash;I believe they are so near akin that
      they can never be united.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. O rather Madam suppose them man and wife because one seldom
      sees them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. But Sir Peter is such an Enemy to Scandal I believe He would
      have it put down by Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. 'Fore heaven! Madam, if they were to consider the Sporting with
      Reputation of as much importance as poaching on manors&mdash;and pass an
      Act for the Preservation of Fame&mdash;there are many would thank them for
      the Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. O Lud! Sir Peter would you deprive us of our Privileges&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye Madam&mdash;and then no person should be permitted to kill
      characters or run down reputations, but qualified old Maids and
      disappointed Widows.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Go, you monster&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. But sure you would not be quite so severe on those who only
      report what they hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes Madam, I would have Law Merchant for that too&mdash;and in
      all cases of slander currency, whenever the Drawer of the Lie was not to
      be found, the injured Party should have a right to come on any of the
      indorsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Well for my Part I believe there never was a Scandalous Tale
      without some foundation.<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"

      SIR BENJAMIN. Well certainly Lady Teazle that lord of yours is a strange

      heartily if He wern't your Husband.
    </p>

     [join the rest of the Company going into the Next Room.]
</pre>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Maria I see you have no satisfaction in this society.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. How is it possible I should? If to raise malicious smiles at the
      infirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be the
      province of wit or Humour, Heaven grant me a double Portion of Dullness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Yet they appear more ill-natured than they are&mdash;they have no
      malice at heart&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Then is their conduct still more contemptible[;] for in my opinion&mdash;nothing
      could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a natural and
      ungovernable bitterness of Mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Undoubtedly Madam&mdash;and it has always been a sentiment of
      mine&mdash;that to propagate a malicious Truth wantonly&mdash;is more
      despicable than to falsify from Revenge, but can you Maria feel thus [f]or
      others and be unkind to me alone&mdash;nay is hope to be denied the
      tenderest Passion.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Why will you distress me by renewing this subject&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Ah! Maria! you would not treat me thus and oppose your guardian's
      Sir Peter's wishes&mdash;but that I see that my Profligate Brother is
      still a favour'd Rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Ungenerously urged&mdash;but whatever my sentiments of that
      unfortunate young man are, be assured I shall not feel more bound to give
      him up because his Distresses have sunk him so low as to deprive him of
      the regard even of a Brother.

      not&mdash;no you shall&mdash;for tho' I have the greatest Regard for Lady

      to reason with her when you came.

    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Indeed but you seem'd to adopt&mdash;a very tender mode of
      reasoning&mdash;do you usually argue on your knees?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. O she's a Child&mdash;and I thought a little Bombast&mdash;&mdash;but
      Lady Teazle when are you to give me your judgment on my Library as you
      promised&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No&mdash;no I begin to think it would be imprudent&mdash;and
      you know I admit you as a Lover no farther than Fashion requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. True&mdash;a mere Platonic Cicisbeo, what every London wife is
      entitled to.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Certainly one must not be out of the Fashion&mdash;however, I
      have so much of my country Prejudices left&mdash;that&mdash;though Sir
      Peter's ill humour may vex me ever so, it never shall provoke me to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. The only revenge in your Power&mdash;well I applaud your
      moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Go&mdash;you are an insinuating Hypocrite&mdash;but we shall
      be miss'd&mdash;let us join the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. True, but we had best not return together.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Well don't stay&mdash;for Maria shan't come to hear any more
      of your Reasoning, I promise you&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit.]
</pre>
    <p>
      SURFACE. A curious Dilemma truly my Politics have run me into. I wanted at
      first only to ingratiate myself with Lady Teazle that she might not be my
      enemy with Maria&mdash;and I have I don't know how&mdash;become her
      serious Lover, so that I stand a chance of Committing a Crime I never
      meditated&mdash;and probably of losing Maria by the Pursuit!&mdash;Sincerely
      I begin to wish I had never made such a Point of gaining so very good a
      character, for it has led me into so many curst Rogueries that I doubt I
      shall be exposed at last.

      SCENE III.&mdash;At SIR PETER'S
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;ROWLEY and SIR OLIVER&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! ha! and so my old Friend is married, hey?&mdash;a
      young wife out of the country!&mdash;ha! ha! that he should have stood
      Bluff to old Bachelor so long and sink into a Husband at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. But you must not rally him on the subject Sir Oliver&mdash;'tis a
      tender Point I assure you though He has been married only seven months.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Ah then he has been just half a year on the stool of
      Repentance&mdash;Poor Peter! But you say he has entirely given up Charles&mdash;never
      sees him, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. His Prejudice against him is astonishing&mdash;and I am sure
      greatly increased by a jealousy of him with Lady Teazle&mdash;which he has
      been industriously led into by a scandalous Society&mdash;in the
      neighbourhood&mdash;who have contributed not a little to Charles's ill
      name. Whereas the truth is[,] I believe[,] if the lady is partial to
      either of them his Brother is the Favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Aye&mdash;I know&mdash;there are a set of malicious prating
      prudent Gossips both male and Female, who murder characters to kill time,
      and will rob a young Fellow of his good name before He has years to know
      the value of it. . . but I am not to be prejudiced against my nephew by
      such I promise you! No! no&mdash;if Charles has done nothing false or
      mean, I shall compound for his extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Then my life on't, you will reclaim him. Ah, Sir, it gives me new
      vigour to find that your heart is not turned against him&mdash;and that
      the son of my good old master has one friend however left&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. What! shall I forget Master Rowley&mdash;when I was at his
      house myself&mdash;egad my Brother and I were neither of us very prudent
      youths&mdash;and yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your
      old master was[.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. 'Tis this Reflection gives me assurance that Charles may yet be a
      credit to his Family&mdash;but here comes Sir Peter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Egad so He does&mdash;mercy on me&mdash;He's greatly altered&mdash;and
      seems to have a settled married look&mdash;one may read Husband in his
      Face at this Distance.&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter SIR PETER
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ha! Sir Oliver&mdash;my old Friend&mdash;welcome to England&mdash;a
      thousand Times!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Thank you&mdash;thank you&mdash;Sir Peter&mdash;and Efaith I
      am as glad to find you well[,] believe me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah! 'tis a long time since we met&mdash;sixteen year I doubt
      Sir Oliver&mdash;and many a cross accident in the Time&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Aye I have had my share&mdash;but, what[!] I find you are
      married&mdash;hey my old Boy&mdash;well&mdash;well it can't be help'd&mdash;and
      so I wish you joy with all my heart&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Thank you&mdash;thanks Sir Oliver.&mdash;Yes, I have entered
      into the happy state but we'll not talk of that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. True true Sir Peter old Friends shouldn't begin on grievances
      at first meeting. No, no&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Take care pray Sir&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well&mdash;so one of my nephews I find is a wild Rogue&mdash;hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Wild!&mdash;oh! my old Friend&mdash;I grieve for your
      disappointment there&mdash;He's a lost young man indeed&mdash;however his
      Brother will make you amends; Joseph is indeed what a youth should be&mdash;everybody
      in the world speaks well of him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. I am sorry to hear it&mdash;he has too good a character to be
      an honest Fellow. Everybody speaks well of him! Psha! then He has bow'd as
      low to Knaves and Fools as to the honest dignity of Virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. What Sir Oliver do you blame him for not making Enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Yes&mdash;if He has merit enough to deserve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well&mdash;well&mdash;you'll be convinced when you know him&mdash;'tis
      edification to hear him converse&mdash;he professes the noblest
      Sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Ah plague on his Sentiments&mdash;if he salutes me with a
      scrap sentence of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directly&mdash;but
      however don't mistake me Sir Peter I don't mean to defend Charles's Errors&mdash;but
      before I form my judgment of either of them, I intend to make a trial of
      their Hearts&mdash;and my Friend Rowley and I have planned something for
      the Purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. And Sir Peter shall own he has been for once mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. My life on Joseph's Honour&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well come give us a bottle of good wine&mdash;and we'll drink
      the Lads' Healths and tell you our scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Alons [Allons], then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. But don't Sir Peter be so severe against your old Friend's
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. 'Tis his Vices and Follies have made me his Enemy.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Come&mdash;come&mdash;Sir Peter consider how early He was left to
      his own guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Odds my Life&mdash;I am not sorry that He has run out of the
      course a little&mdash;for my Part, I hate to see dry Prudence clinging to
      the green juices of youth&mdash;'tis like ivy round a sapling and spoils
      the growth of the Tree.

      SCENE I.&mdash;At SIR PETER'S
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SIR PETER, SIR OLIVER, and ROWLEY
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well, then, we will see the Fellows first and have our wine
      afterwards.&mdash;but how is this, Master Rowley&mdash;I don't see the Jet
      of your scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Why Sir&mdash;this Mr. Stanley whom I was speaking of, is nearly
      related to them by their mother. He was once a merchant in Dublin&mdash;but
      has been ruined by a series of undeserved misfortunes&mdash;and now lately
      coming over to solicit the assistance of his friends here&mdash;has been
      flyng [flung] into prison by some of his Creditors&mdash;where he is now
      with two helpless Boys.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Aye and a worthy Fellow too I remember him. But what is this
      to lead to&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. You shall hear&mdash;He has applied by letter both to Mr. Surface
      and Charles&mdash;from the former he has received nothing but evasive
      promises of future service, while Charles has done all that his
      extravagance has left him power to do&mdash;and He is at this time
      endeavouring to raise a sum of money&mdash;part of which, in the midst of
      his own distresses, I know He intends for the service of poor Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Ah! he is my Brother's Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well, but how is Sir Oliver personally to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Why Sir I will inform Charles and his Brother that Stanley has
      obtain'd permission to apply in person to his Friends&mdash;and as they
      have neither of them ever seen him[,] let Sir Oliver assume his character&mdash;and
      he will have a fair opportunity of judging at least of the Benevolence of
      their Dispositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Pshaw! this will prove nothing&mdash;I make no doubt Charles is
      Coxcomb and thoughtless enough to give money to poor relations if he had
      it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Then He shall never want it&mdash;. I have brought a few
      Rupees home with me Sir Peter&mdash;and I only want to be sure of
      bestowing them rightly.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Then Sir believe me you will find in the youngest Brother one who
      in the midst of Folly and dissipation&mdash;has still, as our immortal
      Bard expresses it,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "a Tear for Pity and a Hand open as the day for melting Charity."
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Pish! What signifies his having an open Hand or Purse either
      when He has nothing left to give!&mdash;but if you talk of humane
      Sentiments&mdash;Joseph is the man&mdash;Well, well, make the trial, if
      you please. But where is the fellow whom you brought for Sir Oliver to
      examine, relative to Charles's affairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Below waiting his commands, and no one can give him better
      intelligence&mdash;This, Sir Oliver, is a friendly Jew, who to do him
      justice, has done everything in his power to bring your nephew to a proper
      sense of his extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Pray let us have him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Desire Mr. Moses to walk upstairs.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Calls to SERVANT.]
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. But Pray why should you suppose he will speak the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Oh, I have convinced him that he has no chance of recovering
      certain Sums advanced to Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver, who
      He knows is arrived; so that you may depend on his Fidelity to his
      interest. I have also another evidence in my Power, one Snake, whom I
      shall shortly produce to remove some of YOUR Prejudices[,] Sir Peter[,]
      relative to Charles and Lady Teazle.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. I have heard too much on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Here comes the honest Israelite.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter MOSES
&mdash;This is Sir Oliver.
</pre>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Sir&mdash;I understand you have lately had great dealings with
      my Nephew Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes Sir Oliver&mdash;I have done all I could for him, but He was
      ruined before He came to me for Assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. That was unlucky truly&mdash;for you have had no opportunity
      of showing your Talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. None at all&mdash;I hadn't the Pleasure of knowing his Distresses
      till he was some thousands worse than nothing, till it was impossible to
      add to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Unfortunate indeed! but I suppose you have done all in your
      Power for him honest Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes he knows that&mdash;This very evening I was to have brought him
      a gentleman from the city who does not know him and will I believe advance
      some money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. What[!] one Charles has never had money from before?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes[&mdash;]Mr. Premium, of Crutched Friars.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Egad, Sir Oliver a Thought strikes me!&mdash;Charles you say
      does'nt know Mr. Premium?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Now then Sir Oliver you may have a better opportunity of
      satisfying yourself than by an old romancing tale of a poor Relation&mdash;go
      with my friend Moses and represent Mr. Premium and then I'll answer for't
      you'll see your Nephew in all his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Egad I like this Idea better than the other, and I may visit
      Joseph afterwards as old Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. True so you may.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Well this is taking Charles rather at a disadvantage, to be sure&mdash;however
      Moses&mdash;you understand Sir Peter and will be faithful&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. You may depend upon me&mdash;and this is near the Time I was to
      have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. I'll accompany you as soon as you please, Moses&mdash;&mdash;but
      hold&mdash;I have forgot one thing&mdash;how the plague shall I be able to
      pass for a Jew?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. There's no need&mdash;the Principal is Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Is He&mdash;I'm very sorry to hear it&mdash;but then again&mdash;an't
      I rather too smartly dressed to look like a money-Lender?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Not at all; 'twould not be out of character, if you went in
      your own carriage&mdash;would it, Moses!
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Not in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well&mdash;but&mdash;how must I talk[?] there's certainly some
      cant of usury and mode of treating that I ought to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Oh, there's not much to learn&mdash;the great point as I take
      it is to be exorbitant enough in your Demands hey Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes that's very great Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. I'll answer for't I'll not be wanting in that&mdash;I'll ask
      him eight or ten per cent. on the loan&mdash;at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. You'll be found out directly&mdash;if you ask him no more than
      that, you'll be discovered immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Hey!&mdash;what the Plague!&mdash;how much then?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. That depends upon the Circumstances&mdash;if he appears not very
      anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent.&mdash;but
      if you find him in great Distress, and want the monies very bad&mdash;you
      may ask double.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. A good&mdash;[h]onest Trade you're learning, Sir Oliver&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Truly, I think so&mdash;and not unprofitable&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Then you know&mdash;you haven't the monies yourself, but are forced
      to borrow them for him of a Friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. O I borrow it of a Friend do I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. And your friend is an unconscion'd Dog&mdash;but you can't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. My Friend's an unconscionable Dog, is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes&mdash;and He himself hasn't the monies by him&mdash;but is
      forced to sell stock&mdash;at a great loss&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. He is forced to sell stock is he&mdash;at a great loss, is he&mdash;well
      that's very kind of him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Efaith, Sir Oliver&mdash;Mr. Premium I mean&mdash;you'll soon
      be master of the Trade&mdash;but, Moses would have him inquire if the
      borrower is a minor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. O yes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And in that case his Conscience will direct him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. To have the Bond in another Name to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well&mdash;well I shall be perfect&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. But hearkee wouldn't you have him also run out a little against
      the annuity Bill&mdash;that would be in character I should think&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Very much&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. And lament that a young man now must be at years of discretion
      before He is suffered to ruin himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Aye, great Pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And abuse the Public for allowing merit to an act whose only
      object is to snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious Relief of
      usury! and give the minor a chance of inheriting his estate without being
      undone by coming into Possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. So&mdash;so&mdash;Moses shall give me further instructions as
      we go together.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. You will not have much time[,] for your Nephew lives hard bye&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Oh Never&mdash;fear[:] my Tutor appears so able that tho'
      Charles lived in the next street it must be my own Fault if I am not a
      compleat Rogue before I turn the Corner&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">

SIR PETER. Well, go bring me this Snake, and I'll hear what he has to
say presently. I see Maria, and want to speak with her.&mdash;

     [Exit ROWLEY.]
I should be glad to be convinced my suspicions of Lady Teazle and
Charles were unjust&mdash;I have never yet opened my mind on this subject to
my Friend Joseph. . . . I am determined. I will do it&mdash;He will give me
his opinion sincerely.&mdash;

     Enter MARIA
</pre>
    <p>
      So Child&mdash;has Mr. Surface returned with you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. No Sir&mdash;He was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well&mdash;Maria&mdash;do you not reflect[,] the more you
      converse with that amiable young man[,] what return his Partiality for you
      deserves?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Indeed Sir Peter&mdash;your frequent importunity on this subject
      distresses me extremely&mdash;you compell me to Declare that I know no man
      who has ever paid me a particular Attention whom I would not prefer to Mr.
      Surface&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Soh! Here's Perverseness&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;Maria, 'tis
      Charles only whom you would prefer&mdash;'tis evident his Vices and
      Follies have won your Heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. This is unkind Sir&mdash;You know I have obey'd you in neither
      seeing nor corresponding with him&mdash;I have heard enough to convince me
      that He is unworthy my regard&mdash;Yet I cannot think it culpable&mdash;if
      while my understanding severely condemns his Vices, my Heart suggests some
      Pity for his Distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well well pity him as much as you please, but give your Heart
      and Hand to a worthier object.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. Never to his Brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Go&mdash;perverse and obstinate! but take care, Madam&mdash;you
      have never yet known what the authority of a Guardian is&mdash;don't
      compel me to inform you of it.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARIA. I can only say, you shall not have just Reason&mdash;'tis true, by
      my Father's will I am for a short period bound to regard you as his
      substitute, but I must cease to think you so when you would compel me to
      be miserable.

      SIR PETER. Was ever man so crossed as I am[?] everything conspiring to
      fret me! I had not been involved in matrimony a fortnight[,] before her
      Father&mdash;a hale and hearty man, died on purpose, I believe&mdash;for
      the Pleasure of plaguing me with the care of his Daughter . . . but here
      comes my Helpmate!&mdash;She appears in great good humour&mdash;&mdash;how
      happy I should be if I could teaze her into loving me tho' but a little&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Lud! Sir Peter I hope you haven't been quarrelling with
      Maria? It isn't using me well to be ill humour'd when I am not bye&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah! Lady Teazle you might have the Power to make me good
      humour'd at all times&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I am sure&mdash;I wish I had&mdash;for I want you to be in a
      charming sweet temper at this moment&mdash;do be good humour'd now&mdash;and
      let me have two hundred Pounds will you?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Two hundred Pounds! what an't I to be in a good humour without
      paying for it&mdash;but speak to me thus&mdash;and Efaith there's nothing
      I could refuse you. You shall have it&mdash;but seal me a bond for the
      repayment.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. O no&mdash;there&mdash;my Note of Hand will do as well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And you shall no longer reproach me with not giving you an
      independent settlement&mdash;I shall shortly surprise you&mdash;and you'll
      not call me ungenerous&mdash;but shall we always live thus&mdash;hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. If you&mdash;please&mdash;I'm sure I don't care how soon we
      leave off quarrelling provided you'll own you were tired first&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Well&mdash;then let our future contest be who shall be most
      obliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I assure you Sir Peter Good Nature becomes you&mdash;you look
      now as you did before we were married&mdash;when you used to walk with me
      under the Elms, and tell me stories of what a Gallant you were in your
      youth&mdash;and chuck me under the chin you would&mdash;and ask me if I
      thought I could love an old Fellow who would deny me nothing&mdash;didn't
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;and you were as kind and attentive&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Aye so I was&mdash;and would always take your Part, when my
      acquaintance used to abuse you and turn you into ridicule&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Aye&mdash;and when my cousin Sophy has called you a stiff
      peevish old batchelor and laugh'd at me for thinking of marrying one who
      might be my Father&mdash;I have always defended you&mdash;and said I
      didn't think you so ugly by any means, and that you'd make a very good
      sort of a husband&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And you prophesied right&mdash;and we shall certainly now be
      the happiest couple&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. And never differ again.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No never&mdash;tho' at the same time indeed&mdash;my dear Lady
      Teazle&mdash;you must watch your Temper very narrowly&mdash;for in all our
      little Quarrels&mdash;my dear&mdash;if you recollect my Love you always
      began first&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I beg your Pardon&mdash;my dear Sir Peter&mdash;indeed&mdash;you
      always gave the provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Now&mdash;see, my Love take care&mdash;contradicting isn't the
      way to keep Friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Then don't you begin it my Love!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. There now&mdash;you are going on&mdash;you don't perceive[,] my
      Life, that you are just doing the very thing my Love which you know always
      makes me angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Nay&mdash;you know if you will be angry without any reason&mdash;my
      Dear&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. There now you want to quarrel again.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No&mdash;I am sure I don't&mdash;but if you will be so
      peevish&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. There&mdash;now who begins first?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Why you to be sure&mdash;I said nothing[&mdash;]but there's
      no bearing your Temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No&mdash;no&mdash;my dear&mdash;the fault's in your own temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Aye you are just what my Cousin Sophy said you would be&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Your Cousin Sophy&mdash;is a forward impertinent Gipsey&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Go you great Bear&mdash;how dare you abuse my Relations&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Now may all the Plagues of marriage be doubled on me, if ever I
      try to be Friends with you any more&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. So much the Better.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No&mdash;no Madam 'tis evident you never cared a pin for me&mdash;I
      was a madman to marry you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. And I am sure I was a Fooll to marry you&mdash;an old
      dangling Batchelor, who was single of [at] fifty&mdash;only because He
      never could meet with any one who would have him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;Madam&mdash;but you were pleased enough to
      listen to me&mdash;you never had such an offer before&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No&mdash;didn't I refuse Sir Jeremy Terrier&mdash;who
      everybody said would have been a better Match&mdash;for his estate is just
      as good as yours&mdash;and he has broke his Neck since we have been
      married!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. I have done with you Madam! You are an unfeeling&mdash;ungrateful&mdash;but
      there's an end of everything&mdash;I believe you capable of anything
      that's bad&mdash;Yes, Madam&mdash;I now believe the Reports relative to
      you and Charles&mdash;Madam&mdash;yes&mdash;Madam&mdash;you and Charles
      are&mdash;not without grounds&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Take&mdash;care Sir Peter&mdash;you had better not insinuate
      any such thing! I'll not be suspected without cause I promise you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Very&mdash;well&mdash;Madam&mdash;very well! a separate
      maintenance&mdash;as soon as you Please. Yes Madam or a Divorce&mdash;I'll
      make an example of myself for the Benefit of all old Batchelors&mdash;Let
      us separate, Madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Agreed&mdash;agreed&mdash;and now&mdash;my dear Sir Peter we
      are of a mind again, we may be the happiest couple&mdash;and never differ
      again, you know&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;Well you are going to be in a Passion
      I see&mdash;and I shall only interrupt you&mdash;so, bye! bye! hey&mdash;young

     Enter TRIP, MOSES, and SIR OLIVER

    <p>
      TRIP. Here Master Moses&mdash;if you'll stay a moment&mdash;I'll try
      whether Mr.&mdash;&mdash;what's the Gentleman's Name?

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Mr.&mdash;&mdash;Moses&mdash;what IS my name&mdash;&mdash;

      SIR OLIVER. To judge by the Servants&mdash;one wouldn't believe the master
      was ruin'd&mdash;but what&mdash;sure this was my Brother's House&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes Sir Mr. Charles bought it of Mr. Joseph with the Furniture,
      Pictures, &amp;c.&mdash;just as the old Gentleman left it&mdash;Sir Peter
      thought it a great piece of extravagance in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. In my mind the other's economy in selling it to him was more
      reprehensible by half.&mdash;&mdash;

      TRIP. My Master[,] Gentlemen[,] says you must wait, he has company, and

      TRIP. Trip Sir&mdash;my Name is Trip, at your Service.

      SIR OLIVER. Well then Mr. Trip&mdash;I presume your master is seldom
      without company&mdash;&mdash;

      TRIP. Very seldom Sir&mdash;the world says ill-natured things of him but
      'tis all malice&mdash;no man was ever better beloved&mdash;Sir he seldom
      sits down to dinner without a dozen particular Friends&mdash;&mdash;

      TRIP. Why yes&mdash;here are three or four of us pass our time agreeably
      enough&mdash;but then our wages are sometimes a little in arrear&mdash;and
      not very great either&mdash;but fifty Pounds a year and find our own Bags

      Bill discounted?

      distresses, I warrant[,] like a Lord&mdash;and affects Creditors and Duns!

    <p>
      MOSES. 'Twas not be done, indeed&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TRIP. Good lack&mdash;you surprise me&mdash;My Friend Brush has indorsed
      it and I thought when he put his name at the Back of a Bill 'twas as good
      as cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. No 'twouldn't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRIP. A small sum&mdash;but twenty Pound&mdash;harkee, Moses do you think
      you could get it me by way of annuity?

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. An annuity! ha! ha! a Footman raise money by annuity&mdash;Well
      done Luxury egad! [Aside.]

      dresses better, nobody throws off faster&mdash;very well this Gentleman
      will stand my security.

    <p>
      MOSES. Well&mdash;but you must insure your Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRIP. O with all my Heart&mdash;I'll insure my Place, and my Life too, if
      you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. It's more than I would your neck&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. But is there nothing you could deposit?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRIP. Why nothing capital of my master's wardrobe has drop'd lately&mdash;but
      I could give you a mortgage on some of his winter Cloaths with equity of
      redemption before November or&mdash;you shall have the reversion&mdash;of
      the French velvet, or a post obit on the Blue and Silver&mdash;these I
      should think Moses&mdash;with a few Pair of Point Ruffles as a collateral
      security&mdash;hey, my little Fellow?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     At Table with Wine
</pre>
    <p>
      CHARLES. 'Fore Heaven, 'tis true!&mdash;there is the great Degeneracy of
      the age&mdash;many of our acquaintance have Taste&mdash;Spirit, and
      Politeness&mdash;but plague on't they won't drink&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. It is so indeed&mdash;Charles&mdash;they give into all the
      substantial Luxuries of the Table&mdash;and abstain from nothing but wine
      and wit&mdash;Oh, certainly society suffers by it intolerably&mdash;for
      now instead of the social spirit of Raillery that used to mantle over a
      glass of bright Burgundy their conversation is become just like the Spa
      water they drink which has all the Pertness and flatulence of champaine
      without its spirit or Flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST GENTLEMAN. But what are they to do who love Play better than wine&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. True&mdash;there's Harry diets himself&mdash;for gaming and is
      now under a hazard Regimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Then He'll have the worst of it&mdash;what you wouldn't train a
      horse for the course by keeping him from corn&mdash;For my Part egad I am
      never so successful as when I'm a little&mdash;merry&mdash;let me throw on
      a Bottle of Champaine and I never lose&mdash;at least I never feel my
      losses which is exactly the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND GENTLEMAN. Aye that may be&mdash;but it is as impossible to follow
      wine and play as to unite Love and Politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Pshaw&mdash;you may do both&mdash;Caesar made Love and Laws in a
      Breath&mdash;and was liked by the Senate as well as the Ladies&mdash;but
      no man can pretend to be a Believer in Love, who is an abjurer of wine&mdash;'tis
      the Test by which a Lover knows his own Heart&mdash;fill a dozen Bumpers
      to a dozen Beauties, and she that floats atop is the maid that has
      bewitched you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Now then Charles&mdash;be honest and give us yours&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Why I have withheld her only in compassion to you&mdash;if I
      toast her you should give a round of her Peers, which is impossible! on
      earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. O, then we'll find some canonized Vestals or heathen Goddesses
      that will do I warrant&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Here then&mdash;Bumpers&mdash;you Rogues&mdash;Bumpers! Maria&mdash;Maria&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST GENTLEMAN. Maria who?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Oh, damn the Surname 'tis too formal to be register'd in Love's
      calendar&mdash;but now Careless beware&mdash;beware&mdash;we must have
      Beauty's superlative.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST GENTLEMAN. Nay Never study[,] Careless&mdash;we'll stand to the
      Toast&mdash;tho' your mistress should want an eye&mdash;and you know you
      have a song will excuse you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Egad so I have&mdash;and I'll give him the song instead of the

     Here's to the girl with a pair of blue eyes,
        And here's to the nymph with but one, sir.
     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &amp;c.

     Here's to the maid with a bosom of snow:
        Now to her that's as brown as a berry:
     Here's to the wife with a face full of woe,
        And now to the damsel that's merry.
     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &amp;c.

     For let 'em be clumsy, or let 'em be slim,
        Young or ancient, I care not a feather;
     So fill a pint bumper quite up to the brim,
     So fill up your glasses, nay, fill to the brim,
        And let us e'en toast them together.
     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &amp;c.

     [Exit.]
</pre>
    <p>
      MOSES. Sir, this is Mr. Premium, a gentleman of the strictest honour and
      secrecy; and always performs what he undertakes. Mr. Premium, this is&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Psha! have done. Sir, my friend Moses is a very honest fellow,
      but a little slow at expression: he'll be an hour giving us our titles.
      Mr. Premium, the plain state of the matter is this: I am an extravagant
      young fellow who wants to borrow money; you I take to be a prudent old
      fellow, who have got money to lend. I am blockhead enough to give fifty
      per cent. sooner than not have it! and you, I presume, are rogue enough to
      take a hundred if you can get it. Now, sir, you see we are acquainted at
      once, and may proceed to business without further ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Exceeding frank, upon my word. I see, sir, you are not a man
      of many compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Oh, no, sir! plain dealing in business I always think best.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Sir, I like you the better for it. However, You are mistaken
      in one thing; I have no money to lend, but I believe I could procure some
      of a friend; but then he's an unconscionable dog. Isn't he, Moses? And
      must sell stock to accommodate you. Mustn't he, Moses!
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes, indeed! You know I always speak the truth, and scorn to tell a
      lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Right. People that speak truth generally do. But these are
      trifles, Mr. Premium. What! I know money isn't to be bought without paying
      for't!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well, but what security could you give? You have no land, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Not a mole-hill, nor a twig, but what's in the bough pots out of
      the window!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Nor any stock, I presume?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Nothing but live stock&mdash;and that's only a few pointers and
      ponies. But pray, Mr. Premium, are you acquainted at all with any of my
      connections?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Why, to say the truth, I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Then you must know that I have a devilish rich uncle in the East
      Indies, Sir Oliver Surface, from whom I have the greatest expectations?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. That you have a wealthy uncle, I have heard; but how your
      expectations will turn out is more, I believe, than you can tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Oh, no!&mdash;there can be no doubt. They tell me I'm a
      prodigious favourite, and that he talks of leaving me everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Indeed! this is the first I've heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Yes, yes, 'tis just so. Moses knows 'tis true; don't you, Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Oh, yes! I'll swear to't.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Egad, they'll persuade me presently I'm at Bengal. [Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Now I propose, Mr. Premium, if it's agreeable to you, a post-obit
      on Sir Oliver's life: though at the same time the old fellow has been so
      liberal to me, that I give you my word, I should be very sorry to hear
      that anything had happened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Not more than I should, I assure you. But the bond you mention
      happens to be just the worst security you could offer me&mdash;for I might
      live to a hundred and never see the principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Oh, yes, you would! the moment Sir Oliver dies, you know, you
      would come on me for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Then I believe I should be the most unwelcome dun you ever had
      in your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. What! I suppose you're afraid that Sir Oliver is too good a life?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. No, indeed I am not; though I have heard he is as hale and
      healthy as any man of his years in Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. There again, now, you are misinformed. No, no, the climate has
      hurt him considerably, poor uncle Oliver. Yes, yes, he breaks apace, I'm
      told&mdash;and is so much altered lately that his nearest relations would
      not know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. No! Ha! ha! ha! so much altered lately that his nearest
      relations would not know him! Ha! ha! ha! egad&mdash;ha! ha! ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ha! ha!&mdash;you're glad to hear that, little Premium?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. No, no, I'm not.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Yes, yes, you are&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;you know that mends
      your chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. But I'm told Sir Oliver is coming over; nay, some say he is
      actually arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Psha! sure I must know better than you whether he's come or not.
      No, no, rely on't he's at this moment at Calcutta. Isn't he, Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Oh, yes, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Very true, as you say, you must know better than I, though I
      have it from pretty good authority. Haven't I, Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Yes, most undoubted!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. But, Sir, as I understand you want a few hundreds immediately,
      is there nothing you could dispose of?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. For instance, now, I have heard that your father left behind
      him a great quantity of massy old plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. O Lud! that's gone long ago. Moses can tell you how better than I
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Good lack! all the family race-cups and
      corporation-bowls!&mdash;[Aloud.] Then it was also supposed that his
      library was one of the most valuable and compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Yes, yes, so it was&mdash;vastly too much so for a private
      gentleman. For my part, I was always of a communicative disposition, so I
      thought it a shame to keep so much knowledge to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Mercy upon me! learning that had run in the family
      like an heir-loom!&mdash;[Aloud.] Pray, what has become of the books?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. You must inquire of the auctioneer, Master Premium, for I don't
      believe even Moses can direct you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. I know nothing of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. So, so, nothing of the family property left, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Not much, indeed; unless you have a mind to the family pictures.
      I have got a room full of ancestors above: and if you have a taste for old
      paintings, egad, you shall have 'em a bargain!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Hey! what the devil! sure, you wouldn't sell your forefathers,
      would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Every man of them, to the best bidder.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. What! your great-uncles and aunts?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ay, and my great-grandfathers and grandmothers too.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Now I give him up!&mdash;[Aloud.] What the plague,
      have you no bowels for your own kindred? Odd's life! do you take me for
      Shylock in the play, that you would raise money of me on your own flesh
      and blood?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Nay, my little broker, don't be angry: what need you care, if you
      have your money's worth?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well, I'll be the purchaser: I think I can dispose of the
      family canvas.&mdash;[Aside.] Oh, I'll never forgive him this! never!

      prodigal!

      SCENE I.&mdash;A Picture Room in CHARLES SURFACE'S House
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter CHARLES, SIR OLIVER, MOSES, and CARELESS
</pre>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in;&mdash;here they are, the family
      of the Surfaces, up to the Conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. And, in my opinion, a goodly collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ay, ay, these are done in the true spirit of portrait-painting;
      no volontiere grace or expression. Not like the works of your modern
      Raphaels, who give you the strongest resemblance, yet contrive to make
      your portrait independent of you; so that you may sink the original and
      not hurt the picture. No, no; the merit of these is the inveterate
      likeness&mdash;all stiff and awkward as the originals, and like nothing in
      human nature besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Ah! we shall never see such figures of men again.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. I hope not. Well, you see, Master Premium, what a domestic
      character I am; here I sit of an evening surrounded by my family. But
      come, get to your pulpit, Mr. Auctioneer; here's an old gouty chair of my
      grandfather's will answer the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Ay, ay, this will do. But, Charles, I haven't a hammer; and
      what's an auctioneer without his hammer?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Egad, that's true. What parchment have we here? Oh, our genealogy
      in full. [Taking pedigree down.] Here, Careless, you shall have no common
      bit of mahogany, here's the family tree for you, you rogue! This shall be
      your hammer, and now you may knock down my ancestors with their own
      pedigree.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. What an unnatural rogue!&mdash;an ex post facto parricide!
      [Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Yes, yes, here's a list of your generation indeed;&mdash;faith,
      Charles, this is the most convenient thing you could have found for the
      business, for 'twill not only serve as a hammer, but a catalogue into the
      bargain. Come, begin&mdash;A-going, a-going, a-going!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Bravo, Careless! Well, here's my great uncle, Sir Richard
      Ravelin, a marvellous good general in his day, I assure you. He served in
      all the Duke of Marlborough's wars, and got that cut over his eye at the
      battle of Malplaquet. What say you, Mr. Premium? look at him&mdash;there's
      a hero! not cut out of his feathers, as your modern clipped captains are,
      but enveloped in wig and regimentals, as a general should be. What do you
      bid?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside to Moses.] Bid him speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Mr. Premium would have you speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Why, then, he shall have him for ten pounds, and I'm sure that's
      not dear for a staff-officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Heaven deliver me! his famous uncle Richard for ten
      pounds!&mdash;[Aloud.] Very well, sir, I take him at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Careless, knock down my uncle Richard.&mdash;Here, now, is a
      maiden sister of his, my great-aunt Deborah, done by Kneller, in his best
      manner, and esteemed a very formidable likeness. There she is, you see, a
      shepherdess feeding her flock. You shall have her for five pounds ten&mdash;the
      sheep are worth the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Ah! poor Deborah! a woman who set such a value on
      herself!&mdash;[Aloud.] Five pounds ten&mdash;she's mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Knock down my aunt Deborah! Here, now, are two that were a sort
      of cousins of theirs.&mdash;You see, Moses, these pictures were done some
      time ago, when beaux wore wigs, and the ladies their own hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Yes, truly, head-dresses appear to have been a little lower in
      those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Well, take that couple for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. 'Tis a good bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Careless!&mdash;This, now, is a grandfather of my mother's, a
      learned judge, well known on the western circuit,&mdash;What do you rate
      him at, Moses?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOSES. Four guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Four guineas! Gad's life, you don't bid me the price of his wig.&mdash;Mr.
      Premium, you have more respect for the woolsack; do let us knock his
      lordship down at fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. By all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. And there are two brothers of his, William and Walter Blunt,
      Esquires, both members of Parliament, and noted speakers; and, what's very
      extraordinary, I believe, this is the first time they were ever bought or
      sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. That is very extraordinary, indeed! I'll take them at your own
      price, for the honour of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Well said, little Premium! I'll knock them down at forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Here's a jolly fellow&mdash;I don't know what relation, but he
      was mayor of Norwich: take him at eight pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. No, no; six will do for the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Come, make it guineas, and I'll throw you the two aldermen here
      into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. They're mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Careless, knock down the mayor and aldermen. But, plague on't! we
      shall be all day retailing in this manner; do let us deal wholesale: what
      say you, little Premium? Give me three hundred pounds for the rest of the
      family in the lump.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Ay, ay, that will be the best way.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well, well, anything to accommodate you; they are mine. But
      there is one portrait which you have always passed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. What, that ill-looking little fellow over the settee?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Yes, sir, I mean that; though I don't think him so ill-looking
      a little fellow, by any means.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. What, that? Oh; that's my uncle Oliver! 'Twas done before he went
      to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Your uncle Oliver! Gad, then you'll never be friends, Charles.
      That, now, to me, is as stern a looking rogue as ever I saw; an
      unforgiving eye, and a damned disinheriting countenance! an inveterate
      knave, depend on't. Don't you think so, little Premium?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Upon my soul, Sir, I do not; I think it is as honest a looking
      face as any in the room, dead or alive. But I suppose uncle Oliver goes
      with the rest of the lumber?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. No, hang it! I'll not part with poor Noll. The old fellow has
      been very good to me, and, egad, I'll keep his picture while I've a room
      to put it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] The rogue's my nephew after all!&mdash;[Aloud.] But,
      sir, I have somehow taken a fancy to that picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. I'm sorry for't, for you certainly will not have it. Oons,
      haven't you got enough of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] I forgive him everything!&mdash;[Aloud.] But, Sir,
      when I take a whim in my head, I don't value money. I'll give you as much
      for that as for all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Don't tease me, master broker; I tell you I'll not part with it,
      and there's an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] How like his father the dog is.&mdash;[Aloud.] Well,
      well, I have done.&mdash;[Aside.] I did not perceive it before, but I
      think I never saw such a striking resemblance.&mdash;[Aloud.] Here is a
      draught for your sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Why, 'tis for eight hundred pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. You will not let Sir Oliver go?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Zounds! no! I tell you, once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Then never mind the difference, we'll balance that another
      time. But give me your hand on the bargain; you are an honest fellow,
      Charles&mdash;I beg pardon, sir, for being so free.&mdash;Come, Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Egad, this is a whimsical old fellow!&mdash;But hark'ee, Premium,
      you'll prepare lodgings for these gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Yes, yes, I'll send for them in a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. But, hold; do now send a genteel conveyance for them, for, I
      assure you, they were most of them used to ride in their own carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. I will, I will&mdash;for all but Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ay, all but the little nabob.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. You're fixed on that?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] A dear extravagant rogue!&mdash;[Aloud.] Good day!
      Come, Moses.&mdash;[Aside.] Let me hear now who dares call him profligate!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit with MOSES.]

    <p>
      CARELESS. Why, this is the oddest genius of the sort I ever met with!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Egad, he's the prince of brokers, I think. I wonder how the devil
      Moses got acquainted with so honest a fellow.&mdash;Ha! here's Rowley.&mdash;Do,
      Careless, say I'll join the company in a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. I will&mdash;but don't let that old blockhead persuade you to
      squander any of that money on old musty debts, or any such nonsense; for
      tradesmen, Charles, are the most exorbitant fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Very true, and paying them is only encouraging them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARELESS. Nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ay, ay, never fear.&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit CARELESS.]
So! this was an odd old fellow, indeed. Let me see, two-thirds of these
five hundred and thirty odd pounds are mine by right. Fore Heaven!
I find one's ancestors are more valuable relations than I took them
for!&mdash;Ladies and gentlemen, your most obedient and very grateful
servant.     [Bows ceremoniously to the pictures.]

     Enter ROWLEY

    <p>
      Ha! old Rowley! egad, you are just come in time to take leave of your old
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Yes, I heard they were a-going. But I wonder you can have such
      spirits under so many distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Why, there's the point! my distresses are so many, that I can't
      affort to part with my spirits; but I shall be rich and splenetic, all in
      good time. However, I suppose you are surprised that I am not more
      sorrowful at parting with so many near relations; to be sure, 'tis very
      affecting; but you see they never move a muscle, so why should I?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. There's no making you serious a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Yes, faith, I am so now. Here, my honest Rowley, here, get me
      this changed directly, and take a hundred pounds of it immediately to old
      Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. A hundred pounds! Consider only&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Gad's life, don't talk about it! poor Stanley's wants are
      pressing, and, if you don't make haste, we shall have some one call that
      has a better right to the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Ah! there's the point! I never will cease dunning you with the old
      proverb&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. BE JUST BEFORE YOU'RE GENEROUS.&mdash;Why, so I would if I could;
      but Justice is an old hobbling beldame, and I can't get her to keep pace
      with Generosity, for the soul of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Yet, Charles, believe me, one hour's reflection&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Ay, ay, it's very true; but, hark'ee, Rowley, while I have, by
      Heaven I'll give; so, damn your economy! and now for hazard.

    <p>
      MOSES. Well sir, I think as Sir Peter said you have seen Mr. Charles in

    <p>

    <p>
      ROWLEY. So&mdash;Sir Oliver&mdash;I find you have made a Purchase&mdash;&mdash;

      SIR OLIVER. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;our young Rake has parted with his

    <p>
      MOSES. Ah! there is the Pity of all! He is so damned charitable.

    <p>
      ROWLEY. And I left a Hosier and two Tailors in the Hall&mdash;who I'm sure
      won't be paid, and this hundred would satisfy 'em.

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Well&mdash;well&mdash;I'll pay his debts and his Benevolences

    <p>
      SERVANT. No Sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. I am surprised she hasn't sent if she is prevented from coming&mdash;!
      Sir Peter certainly does not suspect me&mdash;yet I wish I may not lose
      the Heiress, thro' the scrape I have drawn myself in with the wife&mdash;However,
      Charles's imprudence and bad character are great Points in my Favour.

    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. What[!] Sentiment in soliloquy&mdash;have you been very
      impatient now?&mdash;O Lud! don't pretend to look grave&mdash;I vow I
      couldn't come before&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. O Madam[,] Punctuality is a species of Constancy, a very
      unfashionable quality in a Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Upon my word you ought to pity me, do you now Sir Peter is
      grown so ill-tempered to me of Late! and so jealous! of Charles too that's
      the best of the story isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. I am glad my scandalous Friends keep that up. [Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I am sure I wish He would let Maria marry him&mdash;and then
      perhaps He would be convinced&mdash;don't you&mdash;Mr. Surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Indeed I do not.&mdash;[Aside.] O certainly I do&mdash;for then
      my dear Lady Teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicions were
      of my having any design on the silly Girl&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Well&mdash;well I'm inclined to believe you&mdash;besides I
      really never could perceive why she should have so any admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. O for her Fortune&mdash;nothing else&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. I believe so for tho' she is certainly very pretty&mdash;yet
      she has no conversation in the world&mdash;and is so grave and reserved&mdash;that
      I declare I think she'd have made an excellent wife for Sir Peter.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. So she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Then&mdash;one never hears her speak ill of anybody&mdash;which
      you know is mighty dull&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Yet she doesn't want understanding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No more she does&mdash;yet one is always disapointed when one
      hears [her] speak&mdash;For though her Eyes have no kind of meaning in
      them&mdash;she very seldom talks Nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Nay&mdash;nay surely&mdash;she has very fine eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Why so she has&mdash;tho' sometimes one fancies there's a
      little sort of a squint&mdash;

    <p>
      SURFACE. A squint&mdash;O fie&mdash;Lady Teazle.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Yes yes&mdash;I vow now&mdash;come there is a left-handed
      Cupid in one eye&mdash;that's the Truth on't.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Well&mdash;his aim is very direct however&mdash;but Lady
      Sneerwell has quite corrupted you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No indeed&mdash;I have not opinion enough of her to be taught
      by her, and I know that she has lately rais'd many scandalous hints of me&mdash;which
      you know one always hears from one common Friend, or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Why to say truth I believe you are not more obliged to her than
      others of her acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. But isn't [it] provoking to hear the most ill-natured Things
      said to one and there's my friend Lady Sneerwell has circulated I don't
      know how many scandalous tales of me, and all without any foundation, too;
      that's what vexes me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Aye Madam to be sure that is the Provoking circumstance&mdash;without
      Foundation&mdash;yes yes&mdash;there's the mortification indeed&mdash;for
      when a slanderous story is believed against one&mdash;there certainly is
      no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. No to be sure&mdash;then I'd forgive their malice&mdash;but
      to attack me, who am really so innocent&mdash;and who never say an
      ill-natured thing of anybody&mdash;that is, of any Friend&mdash;! and then
      Sir Peter too&mdash;to have him so peevish&mdash;and so suspicious&mdash;when
      I know the integrity of my own Heart&mdash;indeed 'tis monstrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. But my dear Lady Teazle 'tis your own fault if you suffer it&mdash;when
      a Husband entertains a groundless suspicion of his Wife and withdraws his
      confidence from her&mdash;the original compact is broke and she owes it to
      the Honour of her sex to endeavour to outwit him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Indeed&mdash;So that if He suspects me without cause it
      follows that the best way of curing his jealousy is to give him reason
      for't&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Undoubtedly&mdash;for your Husband [should] never be deceived in
      you&mdash;and in that case it becomes you to be frail in compliment to his
      discernment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. To be sure what you say is very reasonable&mdash;and when the
      consciousness of my own Innocence&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Ah: my dear&mdash;Madam there is the great mistake&mdash;'tis
      this very conscious Innocence that is of the greatest Prejudice to you&mdash;what
      is it makes you negligent of Forms and careless of the world's opinion&mdash;why
      the consciousness of your Innocence&mdash;what makes you thoughtless in
      your Conduct and apt to run into a thousand little imprudences&mdash;why
      the consciousness of your Innocence&mdash;what makes you impatient of Sir
      Peter's temper, and outrageous at his suspicions&mdash;why the
      consciousness of your own Innocence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. 'Tis very true.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Now my dear Lady Teazle if you but once make a trifling Faux Pas
      you can't conceive how cautious you would grow, and how ready to humour
      and agree with your Husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Do you think so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. O I'm sure on't; and then you'd find all scandal would cease at
      once&mdash;for in short your Character at Present is like a Person in a
      Plethora, absolutely dying of too much Health&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. So&mdash;so&mdash;then I perceive your Prescription is that I
      must sin in my own Defence&mdash;and part with my virtue to preserve my
      Reputation.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Exactly so upon my credit Ma'am[.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY TEAZLE. Well certainly this is the oddest Doctrine&mdash;and the
      newest Receipt for avoiding calumny.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. An infallible one believe me&mdash;Prudence like experience must
      be paid for&mdash;
    </p>

      Point of the greatest moment to my Peace&mdash;in short, my good Friend&mdash;Lady
      Teazle's conduct of late has made me very unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Indeed I'm very sorry to hear it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes 'tis but too plain she has not the least regard for me&mdash;but
      what's worse, I have pretty good Authority to suspect that she must have
      formed an attachment to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Indeed! you astonish me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes&mdash;and between ourselves&mdash;I think I have discover'd

      me just as much as it would you&mdash;

    <p>
      SIR PETER. I am convinced of it&mdash;ah&mdash;it is a happiness to have a
      Friend whom one can trust even with one's Family secrets&mdash;but have
      you no guess who I mean?
    </p>

      SURFACE. I haven't the most distant Idea&mdash;it can't be Sir Benjamin
      Backbite.

    <p>
      SIR PETER. O&mdash;No. What say you to Charles?

    <p>
      SURFACE. My Brother&mdash;impossible!&mdash;O no Sir Peter you mustn't
      credit the scandalous insinuations you hear&mdash;no no&mdash;Charles to
      be sure has been charged with many things but go I can never think He
      would meditate so gross an injury&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah! my dear Friend&mdash;the goodness of your own Heart
      misleads you&mdash;you judge of others by yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Certainly Sir Peter&mdash;the Heart that is conscious of its own
      integrity is ever slowest to credit another's Treachery.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. True&mdash;but your Brother has no sentiment[&mdash;]you never
      hear him talk so.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Well there certainly is no knowing what men are capable of&mdash;no&mdash;there
      is no knowing&mdash;yet I can't but think Lady Teazle herself has too much
      Principle&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye but what's Principle against the Flattery of a handsome&mdash;lively
      young Fellow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. That's very true&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And then you know the difference of our ages makes it very
      improbable that she should have any great affection for me&mdash;and if
      she were to be frail and I were to make it Public&mdash;why the Town would
      only laugh at the foolish old Batchelor, who had married a girl&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. That's true&mdash;to be sure People would laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Laugh&mdash;aye and make Ballads&mdash;and Paragraphs and the
      Devil knows what of me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. No&mdash;you must never make it public&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. But then again that the Nephew of my old Friend, Sir Oliver[,]
      should be the Person to attempt such an injury&mdash;hurts me more nearly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Undoubtedly&mdash;when Ingratitude barbs the Dart of Injury&mdash;the
      wound has double danger in it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Aye&mdash;I that was in a manner left his Guardian&mdash;in his
      House he had been so often entertain'd&mdash;who never in my Life denied
      him my advice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. O 'tis not to be credited&mdash;There may be a man capable of
      such Baseness, to be sure&mdash;but for my Part till you can give me
      positive Proofs you must excuse me withholding my Belief. However, if this
      should be proved on him He is no longer a brother of mine I disclaim
      kindred with him&mdash;for the man who can break thro' the Laws of
      Hospitality&mdash;and attempt the wife of his Friend deserves to be
      branded as the Pest of Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. What a difference there is between you&mdash;what noble
      sentiments!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. But I cannot suspect Lady Teazle's honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. I'm sure I wish to think well of her&mdash;and to remove all
      ground of Quarrel between us&mdash;She has lately reproach'd me more than
      once with having made no settlement on her&mdash;and, in our last Quarrel,
      she almost hinted that she should not break her Heart if I was dead.&mdash;now
      as we seem to differ in our Ideas of Expense I have resolved she shall be
      her own Mistress in that Respect for the future&mdash;and if I were to die&mdash;she
      shall find that I have not been inattentive to her Interests while living&mdash;Here
      my Friend are the Draughts of two Deeds which I wish to have your opinion
      on&mdash;by one she will enjoy eight hundred a year independent while I
      live&mdash;and by the other the bulk of my Fortune after my Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. This conduct Sir Peter is indeed truly Generous! I wish it may
      not corrupt my pupil.&mdash;[Aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes I am determined she shall have no cause to complain&mdash;tho'
      I would not have her acquainted with the latter instance of my affection
      yet awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Nor I&mdash;if I could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. And now my dear Friend if you please we will talk over the
      situation of your Hopes with Maria.

      SURFACE. No&mdash;no&mdash;Sir Peter&mdash;another Time if you Please&mdash;[softly].

      SIR PETER. I am sensibly chagrined at the little Progress you seem to make
      in her affection.

      when your Happiness is in Debate [softly]. 'Sdeath I shall be ruined every
      way.
    </p>
    <p>

      YOUR passion, I am sure she's not your Enemy in the Affair.

      might indeed hope for your reformation&mdash;He is a man of Sentiment&mdash;Well!
      there is nothing in the world so noble as a man of Sentiment!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Pshaw! He is too moral by half&mdash;and so apprehensive of his
      good Name, as he calls it, that I suppose He would as soon let a Priest in
      his House as a Girl&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No&mdash;no&mdash;come come,&mdash;you wrong him. No, no,
      Joseph is no Rake but he is no such Saint in that respect either. I have a
      great mind to tell him&mdash;we should have such a Laugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Oh, hang him? He's a very Anchorite&mdash;a young Hermit!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Harkee&mdash;you must not abuse him, he may chance to hear of
      it again I promise you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. Why you won't tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. No&mdash;but&mdash;this way. Egad, I'll tell him&mdash;Harkee,
      have you a mind to have a good laugh against Joseph?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHARLES. I should like it of all things&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Then, E'faith, we will&mdash;I'll be quit with him for
      discovering me.&mdash;He had a girl with him when I called. [Whispers.]

      that smooth-tongued Hypocrite&mdash;who would have seduced the wife of his

      him&mdash;I should have gone first to break you to him.

    <p>
      ROWLEY. As to his way of thinking&mdash;I can't pretend to decide[,] for,
      to do him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as
      any private Gentleman in the Kingdom&mdash;though he is seldom so sensual
      as to indulge himself in the exercise of it&mdash;&mdash;

      MRS. CANDOUR. Mr. Surface!&mdash;why 'twas with Charles Lady Teazle was
      detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. No such thing Mr. Surface is the gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. No&mdash;no&mdash;Charles is the man&mdash;'twas Mr. Surface
      brought Sir Peter on purpose to discover them&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. I tell you I have it from one&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. And I have it from one&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Who had it from one who had it&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. From one immediately&mdash;but here comes Lady Sneerwell&mdash;perhaps
      she knows the whole affair.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter LADY SNEERWELL
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. So&mdash;my dear Mrs. Candour Here's a sad affair of our
      Friend Teazle&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Aye my dear Friend, who could have thought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Well there is no trusting to appearances[;] tho'&mdash;indeed
      she was always too lively for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. To be sure, her manners were a little too&mdash;free&mdash;but
      she was very young&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. And had indeed some good Qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. So she had indeed&mdash;but have you heard the Particulars?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. No&mdash;but everybody says that Mr. Surface&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Aye there I told you&mdash;Mr. Surface was the Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. No&mdash;no&mdash;indeed the assignation was with Charles&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. With Charles!&mdash;You alarm me Mrs. Candour!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Yes&mdash;yes He was the Lover&mdash;Mr. Surface&mdash;do
      him justice&mdash;was only the Informer.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Well I'll not dispute with you Mrs. Candour&mdash;but be it
      which it may&mdash;I hope that Sir Peter's wound will not&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Sir Peter's wound! O mercy! I didn't hear a word of their
      Fighting&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Nor I a syllable!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. No&mdash;what no mention of the Duel&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Not a word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. O, Lord&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;they fought before they
      left the Room.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Pray let us hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Aye&mdash;do oblige&mdash;us with the Duel&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. 'Sir'&mdash;says Sir Peter&mdash;immediately after the
      Discovery, 'you are a most ungrateful Fellow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Aye to Charles&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. No, no&mdash;to Mr. Surface&mdash;'a most ungrateful Fellow;
      and old as I am, Sir,' says He, 'I insist on immediate satisfaction.'
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Aye that must have been to Charles for 'tis very unlikely
      Mr. Surface should go to fight in his own House.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Gad's Life, Ma'am, not at all&mdash;giving me immediate
      satisfaction&mdash;on this, Madam&mdash;Lady Teazle seeing Sir Peter in
      such Danger&mdash;ran out of the Room in strong Hysterics&mdash;and
      Charles after her calling out for Hartshorn and Water! Then Madam&mdash;they
      began to fight with Swords&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Enter CRABTREE
</pre>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. With Pistols&mdash;Nephew&mdash;I have it from undoubted
      authority.

    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Oh, Mr. Crabtree then it is all true&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Too true indeed Ma'am, and Sir Peter Dangerously wounded&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. By a thrust in second&mdash;quite thro' his left side
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. By a Bullet lodged in the Thorax&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Mercy&mdash;on me[!] Poor Sir Peter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes, ma'am tho' Charles would have avoided the matter if he
      could&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I knew Charles was the Person&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. O my Unkle I see knows nothing of the matter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. But Sir Peter tax'd him with the basest ingratitude&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. That I told you, you know&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Do Nephew let me speak&mdash;and insisted on immediate&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Just as I said&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Odds life! Nephew allow others to know something too&mdash;A
      Pair of Pistols lay on the Bureau&mdash;for Mr. Surface&mdash;it seems,
      had come home the Night before late from Salt-Hill where He had been to
      see the Montem with a Friend, who has a Son at Eton&mdash;so unluckily the
      Pistols were left Charged&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. I heard nothing of this&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one and they fired&mdash;it
      seems pretty nearly together&mdash;Charles's shot took Place as I tell you&mdash;and
      Sir Peter's miss'd&mdash;but what is very extraordinary the Ball struck
      against a little Bronze Pliny that stood over the Fire Place&mdash;grazed
      out of the window at a right angle&mdash;and wounded the Postman, who was
      just coming to the Door with a double letter from Northamptonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. My Unkle's account is more circumstantial I must confess&mdash;but
      I believe mine is the true one for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I am more interested in this Affair than they imagine&mdash;and
      must have better information.&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Exit.]

    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes yes, they certainly DO say&mdash;but that's neither here nor
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. But pray where is Sir Peter at present&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Oh! they&mdash;brought him home and He is now in the House, tho'
      the Servants are order'd to deny it&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. I believe so&mdash;and Lady Teazle&mdash;I suppose attending
      him&mdash;&mdash;

      CRABTREE. Well, Doctor&mdash;what Hopes?

    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Aye Doctor how's your Patient?

    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Now Doctor isn't it a wound with a small sword&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. A bullet lodged in the Thorax&mdash;for a hundred!

    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Perhaps, Sir, you are not a Doctor.

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Truly Sir I am to thank you for my degree If I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Only a Friend of Sir Peter's then I presume&mdash;but, sir, you
      must have heard of this accident&mdash;

    <p>

      SIR BENJAMIN. By one Mr. Surface&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Aye the younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your
      accounts&mdash;however you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. Oh yes, we agree in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRABTREE. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Then, upon my word, for a person in that Situation, he is the
      most imprudent man alive&mdash;For here he comes walking as if nothing at
      all was the matter.

    <p>
      Odd's heart, sir Peter! you are come in good time I promise you, for we

    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. 'Egad, Uncle this is the most sudden Recovery!

      your Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. A Small Sword and a Bullet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Aye these Gentlemen would have kill'd you without Law or
      Physic, and wanted to dub me a Doctor to make me an accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Why! what is all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the Story of the Duel is not
      true&mdash;and are sincerely sorry for your other Misfortune.

    <p>
      SIR PETER. So&mdash;so&mdash;all over the Town already! [Aside.]

    <p>
      SIR PETER. Sir, what Business is that of yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Tho' Indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a Husband, he's very
      much to be pitied.

    <p>
      SIR PETER. Plague on your pity, Ma'am, I desire none of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR BENJAMIN. However Sir Peter, you must not mind the Laughing and jests
      you will meet with on the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house.

      CRABTREE. 'Tis no Uncommon Case, that's one comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. I insist on being left to myself, without ceremony,&mdash;I
      insist on your leaving my house directly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANDOUR. Well, well, we are going and depend on't, we'll make the
      best report of you we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Leave my house!

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. Aye as Sir Peter says, He's a man of Sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. And acts up to the Sentiments he professes.

      Sir Peter? you don't Join us in your Friend Joseph's Praise as I expected.

    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Every circumstance!

      SIR PETER. What of the closet and the screen&mdash;hey[?]

    <p>
      SIR PETER. 'Twas very pleasant!

    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes his sentiments! ha! ha! a hypocritical Villain!

      closet: ha! ha!

    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ha! ha! 'twas devilish entertaining to be sure&mdash;

      when the screen was thrown down&mdash;ha! ha!

    <p>
      SIR PETER. Yes, my face when the Screen was thrown down: ha! ha! ha! O I
      must never show my head again!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. But come&mdash;come it isn't fair to laugh at you neither my
      old Friend&mdash;tho' upon my soul I can't help it&mdash;

    <p>
      SIR PETER. O pray don't restrain your mirth on my account: it does not

      think being a standing Jest for all one's acquaintance a very happy
      situation&mdash;O yes&mdash;and then of a morning to read the Paragraphs
      about Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, Lady T&mdash;&mdash;, and Sir P&mdash;&mdash;,
      will be so entertaining!&mdash;I shall certainly leave town tomorrow and
      never look mankind in the Face again!

    <p>
      ROWLEY. Without affectation Sir Peter, you may despise the ridicule of
      Fools&mdash;but I see Lady Teazle going towards the next Room&mdash;I am
      sure you must desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR OLIVER. Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to you&mdash;well
      I'll leave honest Rowley to mediate between you; but he must bring you all
      presently to Mr. Surface's&mdash;where I am now returning&mdash;if not to
      reclaim a Libertine, at least to expose Hypocrisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. Ah! I'll be present at your discovering yourself there with all
      my heart; though 'tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries.

      ROWLEY. And will you refrain from comforting her&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      ROWLEY. O this is ungenerous in you&mdash;

      Letter I found of her's&mdash;evidently intended for Charles?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROWLEY. A mere forgery, Sir Peter&mdash;laid in your way on Purpose&mdash;this
      is one of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR PETER. I wish I were once satisfied of that&mdash;She looks this way&mdash;&mdash;what
      a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has! Rowley I'll go to her&mdash;

    <p>
      ROWLEY. Certainly&mdash;

      them you are happy in spite of it.

      SURFACE. Can Passion&mdash;furnish a Remedy?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. No&mdash;nor cunning either. O I was a Fool, an Ideot&mdash;to
      league with such a Blunderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Sufferer&mdash;yet you
      see I bear the accident with Calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Because the Disappointment hasn't reached your HEART&mdash;your
      interest only attached you to Maria&mdash;had you felt for her&mdash;what
      I have for that ungrateful Libertine&mdash;neither your Temper nor
      Hypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this
      Disappointment?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Are not you the cause of it? what had you to bate in your
      Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the way.&mdash;had you not a
      sufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting
      your Brother&mdash;I hate such an avarice of crimes&mdash;'tis an unfair
      monopoly and never prospers.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURFACE. Well I admit I have been to blame&mdash;I confess I deviated from
      the direct Road of wrong but I don't think we're so totally defeated
      neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. No!
    </p>
    <p>

      that you still believe him faithful to us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I do believe so.

      and prove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to
      your Ladyship&mdash;which some of his former letters to you will serve to
      support&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. This, indeed, might have assisted&mdash;

      me judges and Generals by the Foot, and Maiden Aunts as cheap as broken
      China!

    <p>
      CHARLES. To be sure, Sir Oliver, I did make a little free with the Family
      Canvas that's the truth on't:&mdash;my Ancestors may certainly rise in
      judgment against me there's no denying it&mdash;but believe me sincere
      when I tell you, and upon my soul I would not say so if I was not&mdash;that
      if I do not appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies, it is because
      I feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you, my liberal
      benefactor.

      ill-looking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace.

     EPILOGUE

     BY MR. COLMAN

     SPOKEN BY LADY TEAZLE

     I, who was late so volatile and gay,
     Like a trade-wind must now blow all one way,
     Bend all my cares, my studies, and my vows,
     To one dull rusty weathercock&mdash;my spouse!
     So wills our virtuous bard&mdash;the motley Bayes
     Of crying epilogues and laughing plays!
     Old bachelors, who marry smart young wives,
     Learn from our play to regulate your lives:
     Each bring his dear to town, all faults upon her&mdash;
     London will prove the very source of honour.
     Plunged fairly in, like a cold bath it serves,
     When principles relax, to brace the nerves:
     Such is my case; and yet I must deplore
     That the gay dream of dissipation's o'er.
     And say, ye fair! was ever lively wife,
     Born with a genius for the highest life,
     Like me untimely blasted in her bloom,
     Like me condemn'd to such a dismal doom?
     Save money&mdash;when I just knew how to waste it!
     Leave London&mdash;just as I began to taste it!
       Must I then watch the early crowing cock,
     The melancholy ticking of a clock;
     In a lone rustic hall for ever pounded,
     With dogs, cats, rats, and squalling brats surrounded?
     With humble curate can I now retire,
     (While good Sir Peter boozes with the squire,)
     And at backgammon mortify my soul,
     That pants for loo, or flutters at a vole?
     Seven's the main!  Dear sound that must expire,
     Lost at hot cockles round a Christmas fire;
     The transient hour of fashion too soon spent,
     Farewell the tranquil mind, farewell content!
     Farewell the plumed head, the cushion'd tete,
     That takes the cushion from its proper seat!
     That spirit-stirring drum!&mdash;card drums I mean,
     Spadille&mdash;odd trick&mdash;pam&mdash;basto&mdash;king and queen!
     And you, ye knockers, that, with brazen throat,
     The welcome visitors' approach denote;
     Farewell all quality of high renown,
     Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious town!
     Farewell! your revels I partake no more,
     And Lady Teazle's occupation's o'er!
     All this I told our bard; he smiled, and said 'twas clear,
     I ought to play deep tragedy next year.
     Meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play,
     And in these solemn periods stalk'd away:&mdash;
     "Bless'd were the fair like you; her faults who stopp'd,
     And closed her follies when the curtain dropp'd!
     No more in vice or error to engage,
     Or play the fool at large on life's great stage."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
