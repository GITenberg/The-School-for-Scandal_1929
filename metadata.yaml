description: The School for Scandal is a comedy of manners written by Richard Brinsley
  Sheridan. It was first performed in London at Drury Lane Theatre on May 18, 1777.
  With principal themes of "the deceptive nature of appearances, the fickleness of
  reputation, [and] the often disreputable guises behind which goodness and honesty
  can conceal itself," it has been noted that "The play remains to this day a crowd-pleaser
  and one of the standard repertory pieces in our dramatic literature.". [Adapted
